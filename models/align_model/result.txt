for not alone the death of fulvia , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home .
fulvia 's death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons i am eager to go ; friends in rome have also sent many letters advising my return .

caesar , i bring thee word menecrates and menas , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind .
caesar , i have news about menecrates and menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
many hot inroads they make in italy the borders maritime lack blood to think on 't and flush youth revolt .
they 've made many raids upon italy and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
no vessel can peep forth , but 't is as soon taken as seen , for pompey 's name strikes more than could his war resisted .
these pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor , since the simple mention of the name pompey carries as much power as a fleet of troops in battle .

that 's exactly how he is !
his brother warred upon him , although , i think , not moved by antony .
i do n't expect caesar and antony will have a very friendly reunion .
i know not , menas , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .
menas , i do n't understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference , we yet not know .
but it 's possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences , though how that will work out , we can not say .

nay , she is worse ; she is the devil 's dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
no , she 's worse : she 's the devil 's mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
and thereof comes that the wenches say god damn me that 's as much to say god make me a light wench .
and that 's why some women say , god damn me , which is the same thing as saying , god make me an easy wench .
it is written they appear to men like angels of light .
the bible says the devil looks like an angel of light .

because of the old saying : he who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon .
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain .
he has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .
his wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he 's having .
this course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .
it 's my best option : i ca n't afford to lose forty ducats .
five hundred ducats , villain , for a rope ?
five hundred ducats for a rope ?
i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .

let him not come near me .
keep him away from me !
fetch our stuff from thence .
go to the centaur and get our stuff .
good sir , draw near to me .
good sir , stay close to me .
i 'll speak to him .
i 'll speak to him .
which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
which of these bad things happened to him ?
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .
healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
therefore depart and leave him here with me .
therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
yet once again proclaim it publicly , if any friend will pay the sum for him , he shall not die ; so much we tender him .
one more time , we proclaim this publicly : if anyone will pay this man 's bail , he will not be put to death .
once did i get him bound and sent him home whilst to take order for the wrongs i went that here and there his fury had committed .
at one point i managed to get him tied up and sent home so that i could make some order out of all the trouble he caused .
ay me , it is my husband .
oh , my , it 's my husband .
even for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .

both of them are liars : the madman accuses them justly .
in the street i met him , and in his company that gentleman .
i met him in the street he was there with that man .
along with them they brought one pinch , a hungry , lean - faced villain , a mere anatomy , a mountebank , a threadbare juggler , and a fortune - teller , a needy , hollow - eyed , sharp - looking wretch , a living dead man .
one of them was a man named pinch : a hungry , narrow - faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune - teller ; a needy , hollow - eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
i never came within these abbey walls , nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me .
i was never inside this abbey , and you never raised your sword against me .
adriana if he were mad , he would not plead so coldly .
adriana if you put him in the abbey , that 's where he 'd be .
ourselves we do remember , sir , by you .
you 're not one of pinch 's patients , are you , sir ?
all these old witnesses i can not err tell me thou art my son antipholus .
all these aging faculties tell me and i can not be wrong that you are my son , antipholus .
i tell thee , syracusian , twenty years have i been patron to antipholus , during which time he ne'er saw syracusa .
i 've been looking after antipholus for twenty years , and during that time he 's never been to syracuse .
antipholus one of these men is genius to the other .
antipholus one of these men is the other 's genius .
why , here begins his morning story right ; these two antipholuses , these two so like , and these two dromios , one in semblance besides her urging of her wreck at sea these are the parents to these children , which accidentally are met together .
these two antipholuses , who look so alike and these two dromios , who seem to have the same face and her story of being shipwrecked why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
luciana what i told you then i hope i shall have leisure to make good , if this be not a dream i see and hear .

he speaks to me .
he means me .

i 'm your master , dromio .
will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
do you want to go in and join the party ?

and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons .
and then it acted startled , like a guilty person caught by the law .
it faded on the crowing of the cock .
yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
but look , the morn , in russet mantle clad , walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill .
do n't you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
good hamlet , cast thy nighted color off , and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark .
you ca n't spend your whole life with your eyes to the ground remembering your noble father .
all that lives must die , passing through nature to eternity .
it happens all the time , what lives must die eventually , passing to eternity .
't is sweet and commendable in your nature , hamlet , to give these mourning duties to your father .
please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father .
let not thy mother lose her prayers , hamlet .
please answer my prayers , hamlet , and stay with us .

heaven and earth , must i remember ?
oh god , do i have to remember that ?
within a month , ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galld eyes , she married .
she would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she could n't get enough of him .
and what make you from wittenberg , horatio ?
but what are you doing so far from wittenberg , horatio ?
marcellus !
oh , marcellus ?
i knew your father .
i knew your father .
but even then the morning cock crew loud , and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanished from our sight .
it raised its head once as if it was about to speak , but just then the rooster started crowing , and the ghost vanished from sight .
his greatness weighed , his will is not his own , for he himself is subject to his birth .
he may love you now , and may have only the best intentions , but you have to be on your guard .
he may not , as unvalued persons do , carve for himself , for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state .
he ca n't simply make personal choices for himself the way common people can , since the whole country depends on what he does .
yet here , laertes ?
you 're still here ?
give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportioned thought his act .
but do n't waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet .
take each man 's censure but reserve thy judgment .
hear everyone 's opinion , but reserve your judgment .
your servants tend .
your servants are waiting .
ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
make yourself a precious commodity .
set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley .
remember that hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
and indeed it takes from our achievements , though performed at height , the pith and marrow of our attribute .
and our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
why , what should be the fear ?
i do n't value my life one bit .
i 'll follow it .
i 'll follow it .
where wilt thou lead me ?
where are you taking me ?
now , hamlet , hear .
now listen , hamlet .
't is given out that , sleeping in my orchard , a serpent stung me .
everyone was told that a poisonous snake bit me when i was sleeping in the orchard .
but know , thou noble youth , the serpent that did sting thy father 's life now wears his crown .
you should know , my noble son , the real snake that stung your father is now wearing his crown .
let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damnd incest .
do n't let the danish king 's bed be a nest of incest .
but howsoever thou pursuest this act , taint not thy mind , nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught .
but however you go about your revenge , do n't corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother .
remember me .
remember me .
i 'm sorry they offend you , heartily .
i 'm sorry if i offended you ; yes , very sorry .

ophelia , what 's the matter ?
long stayed he so .
he stayed like that a long time .
i will go seek the king .
i 'll go tell the king about this .
i am sorry .
i 'm so sorry .
this must be known , which , being kept close , might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love .
it 's as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .
welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .
moreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending .
i 've wanted to see you for a long time now , but i sent for you so hastily because i need your help right away .

that we find out the cause of this effect , or rather say , the cause of this defect , for this effect defective comes by cause .
now , if we agree hamlet 's crazy , then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness , or i suppose i should say the cause of this defect , since this defective effect is caused by something .
i will be faithful .
i 'll read it to you .
o dear ophelia , i am ill at these numbers .
oh , ophelia , i 'm bad at poetry .

and then i prescripts gave her , that she should lock herself from his resort , admit no messengers , receive no tokens .
and then i gave her orders to stay away from him , and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow .
in fact , i consider ambition to be so light and airy that it 's only the shadow of a shadow .
but in the beaten way of friendship , what make you at elsinore ?
but tell me as my friends , what are you doing here at elsinore ?
come , come , deal justly with me .
did someone tell you to visit me ?
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
anything you like , as long as it answers my question .
so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery , and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather .
i 'll tell you why so you wo n't have to tell and give away any secrets you have with the king and queen .
man delights not me .
men do n't interest me .
no , nor woman neither , though by your smiling you seem to say so .
no women neither , but you 're smiling , so you must think they do .

we 'll watch a whole play tomorrow .
first player dost thou hear me , old friend ?
first player my friend , can you perform ?
good - bye to you .
ah yes , good - bye to you both .
now i am alone .
now i 'm alone .
oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !
oh , what a mean low - life i am !
am i a coward ?
am i a coward ?
'swounds , i should take it , for it can not be but i am pigeon - livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter , or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave 's offal .
by god , if someone would do that to me , i 'd take it , because i 'm a lily - livered man otherwise , i would 've fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low - life king a long time ago .
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
remorseless , treacherous , sex - obsessed , unnatural villain !
why , what an ass am i !
what an ass i am .
fie upon 't , foh !
i 'm so damn brave .
hum , i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have , by the very cunning of the scene , been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions .
my dear father 's been murdered , and i 've been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell , and yet all i can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets .
the play 's the thing wherein i 'll catch the conscience of the king .
the play 's the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
he does confess he feels himself distracted .
he admits he feels confused , but refuses to say why .
they are about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .
they are here at court now , and i believe they 've been told to give a performance for him tonight .
that is the question whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , or to take arms against a sea of troubles , and , by opposing , end them ?
is it nobler to put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way , or to fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them once and for all ?
to die , to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 't is a consummation devoutly to be wished !
dying , sleeping that 's all dying is a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us that 's an achievement to wish for .
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , th ' oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law 's delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns that patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?
after all , who would put up with all life 's humiliations the abuse from superiors , the insults of arrogant men , the pangs of unrequited love , the inefficiency of the legal system , the rudeness of people in office , and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits ?
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death , the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns , puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life , unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death , the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns , which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we do n't ?
soft you now , the fair ophelia !
but , here comes the beautiful ophelia .
get thee to a nunnery .
get yourself to a at once .
why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ?
why would you want to give birth to more sinners ?
or , if thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool , for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them .
or if you have to get married , marry a fool , since wise men know far too well that you 'll cheat on them .
but , if you hold it fit , after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief .
if she ca n't find out what his secret is , then send him off to england or wherever you think best .
but if you mouth it , as many of your players do , i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines .
if you exaggerate the words the way some actors do , i might as well have some newscaster read the lines .
nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus , but use all gently , for in the very torrent , tempest , and ( as i may say ) whirlwind of passion , you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness .
i hate it when i hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds , bursting everyone 's eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse , who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows .
i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant .
i would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .
but do n't be too tame , either let your good sense guide you .
that did i , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
i was considered to be quite a good actor .

my god , do you think i 'm easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
't is now the very witching time of night , when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world .
this is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
soft , now to my mother .
but i 've got to go see my mother .
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ?
so what if this cursed hand of mine is coated with my brother 's blood ?
now he is a - praying .
he 's praying now .
that would be scanned .
and now i 'll do it .
and am i then revenged
and that 's my revenge .
no .

look you , how pale he glares !
look how pale he is and how he glares at me .
his form and cause conjoined , preaching to stones , would make them capable .
ghost do n't look at me like that , unless you want me to cry instead of kill .
good night but go not to mine uncle 's bed .
but do n't go to my uncle 's bed tonight .
refrain tonight , and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence , the next more easy .
habit is a terrible thing , in that it 's easy to get used to doing evil without feeling bad about it .
for use almost can change the stamp of nature , and either rein the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency .
god wanted to punish me with this murder , and this man with me , so i 'm both heaven 's executioner and its minister of justice .

o gertrude , come away !
oh , gertrude , let 's go .

hey , guildenstern !
come , gertrude , we 'll call up our wisest friends , and let them know both what we mean to do and what 's untimely done .
we 'll confer with our wisest friends and tell them what we 're going to do , and what terrible deed has been done already .
lord hamlet !
hamlet , lord hamlet !
ay , sir , that soaks up the king 's countenance , his rewards , his authorities .
yes , sir , a sponge that soaks up the king 's approval , his rewards , and his decisions .
but such officers do the king best service in the end .
officers like that give the king the best service in the end .
when he needs what you have gleaned , it is but squeezing you and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
when he needs what you have found out , he can just squeeze you like a sponge and you 'll be dry again .
i 'll have him hence tonight .
i want him out of here tonight .

look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who 's so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk , exposing it to danger and death , for a reason as thin as an eggshell .
she is importunate , indeed distract .
you ca n't help feeling sorry for her .
she speaks much of her father , says she hears there 's tricks i ' th ' world , and hems , and beats her heart , spurns enviously at straws , speaks things in doubt that carry but half sense .
she talks about her father a lot , and says she hears there are conspiracies around the world , and coughs , and beats her breast , and gets angry over tiny matters , and talks nonsense .
her speech is nothing , yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection .
her winks and nods and gestures do suggest that she means to convey a message , and not a happy one .

the ocean , overpeering of his list , eats not the flats with more impiteous haste than young laertes , in a riotous head , o'erbears your officers .
it 's as if they were starting the world from scratch right now , throwing out the traditions and ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter .
caps , hands , and tongues applaud it to the clouds : laertes shall be king , laertes king !
they throw their caps in the air and yell , laertes will be king !

horatio

horatio , when thou shalt have overlooked this , give these fellows some means to the king .
horatio , when you 've read this letter , find a way to let these guys see the king .

't is hamlet 's character .
it 's hamlet 's writing .
two months since , here was a gentleman of normandy .
two months ago i met a gentleman from normandy .
i 've seen myself , and served against , the french , and they can well on horseback .
i 've fought against the french and have seen how well they ride , but this man was a magician on horseback .
that we would do , we should do when we would , for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues , are hands , are accidents .
we should do what we intend to do right when we intend it , since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life .
and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing .
and then all our woulds and shoulds are nothing but hot air .
but to the quick of th ' ulcer : hamlet comes back .
but back to my point : hamlet 's coming back .
no place , indeed , should murder sanctuarize .
but laertes , will you do this : stay in your room ?
hamlet returned shall know you are come home .
when hamlet comes home he 'll learn you 're here .
let 's follow , gertrude .
let 's follow him , gertrude .
argal , she drowned herself wittingly .
an act has three sides to it : to do , to act , and to perform .
but if the water come to him and drown him , he drowns not himself .
but if the water comes to him and drowns him , then he does n't drown himself .

how the knave jowls it to the ground , as if it were cain 's jawbone , that did the first murder !
that jackass is throwing it around as if it belonged to cain , who did the first murder !
why may not that be the skull of a lawyer ?
could that be a lawyer 's skull ?
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery ?
why does he allow this idiot to knock him on the head with a dirty shovel , instead of suing him for assault and battery ?
will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures ?
maybe this guy was once a great landowner , with his deeds and contracts , his tax shelters and his annuities .
the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box , and must the inheritor himself have no more , ha ?
does he only get to keep as much land as a set of contracts would cover if you spread them out on the ground ?
this skull has lain in the earth three - and - twenty years .
here 's a skull that 's been here twenty - three years .
imperious caesar , dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
the great emperor caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .

oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
that is laertes , a very noble youth , mark .
that 's laertes , a very noble young man .

and so will i .
so will i .
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us , till our ground , singeing his pate against the burning zone , make ossa like a wart !
it will be so high a peak that it scrapes against heaven and makes mount ossa look like a wart .
wilt thou know th ' effect of what i wrote ?
so there i was , caught in their evil net .
sir , here is newly come to court laertes , believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent differences , of very soft society and great showing .
he 's an absolute gentleman , totally outstanding in so many respects , very easy in society , and displaying all his excellent qualities .
but , on : six barbary horses against six french swords , their assigns , and three liberal - conceited carriages that 's the french bet against the danish .
six barbary horses , six french swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages sounds like a french bet against the danish .
he did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
he used to praise his mother 's nipple before he sucked it .
we defy augury .
let it be .
i 've done you wrong .
i 've done you wrong .
this presence knows , and you must needs have heard , how i am punished with sore distraction .
everyone here knows and i 'm sure you 've heard that i 'm suffering from a serious mental illness .
was 't hamlet wronged laertes ?
was hamlet the one who insulted laertes ?
never hamlet .
no , not hamlet .
his madness is poor hamlet 's enemy .
hamlet 's mental illness is .
but since he is better we have therefore odds .
he 's got to outdo you by three hits to win .
i am dead , horatio .
i 'm dying , horatio .
wretched queen , adieu !

o , i die , horatio .
oh , i 'm dying , horatio !
i can not live to hear the news from england .
i will not live to hear the news from england .
but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras .
but i bet fortinbras will win the election to the danish crown .
so tell him , with th ' occurrents , more and less , which have solicited .
oh , oh , oh , oh .
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing , to tell him his commandment is fulfilled , that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .
we meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .
such a sight as this becomes the field , but here shows much amiss .
he would have been a great king if he had had the chance to prove himself .
then should the warlike harry , like himself , assume the port of mars , and at his heels , leashed in like hounds , should famine , sword , and fire crouch for employment .
then valiant king harry would resemble the god of war , as he did in life , and famine , sword , and fire would sit like dogs at his feet , waiting to be unleashed .
or may we cram within this wooden the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt ?
could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at agincourt ?
suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreard and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder .
pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean .

thus runs the bill .
that 's what the bill says .
hear him debate of commonwealth affairs , you would say it hath been all in all his study .
hear him debate matters of domestic policy , and you 'd swear he had made them his constant study .
but , my good lord , how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons ?
but tell me , my lord : as to the softening of this bill proposed by the house of commons , does his majesty favor it or not ?
sure we thank you .
thank you , i 'm sure .
my learnd lord , we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim .
my learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this french salic law either should or should n't bar me in my claim .
then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers that owe yourselves , your lives , and services to this imperial throne .
then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
besides , their writers say , king pepin , which deposd childeric , did , as heir general , being descended of blithild , which was daughter to king clothair , make claim and title to the crown of france .
besides , according to the french historians , king pepin , who deposed childeric , based his own claim to the crown of france on his descent from blithild , the daughter of king clothair .
hugh capet also , who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine , sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great , to find his title with some shows of truth , though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , conveyed himself as th ' heir to th ' lady lingare , daughter to charlemagne , who was the son to lewis the emperor , and lewis the son of charles the great .
another case : hugh capet , who usurped the crown from charles the duke of lorraine sole male heir in a direct line from charles the great passed himself off as heir to lady lingare , daughter of charlemagne , who was the son of lewis the emperor ( who was the son of charles the great ) , in order to give his claim to the throne more validity ( though , in fact , the claim was completely false and worthless ) .
also king lewis the tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper capet , could not keep quiet in his conscience , wearing the crown of france , till satisfied that fair queen isabel , his grandmother , was lineal of the lady ermengare , daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine , by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france .
another case : king lewis the tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that queen isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the lady ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned charles duke of lorraine , by which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited with the throne of france .
so that , as clear as is the summer 's sun , king pepin 's title and hugh capet 's claim , king lewis his satisfaction , all appear to hold in right and title of the female .
thus , it should be clear as day that king pepin 's title , hugh capet 's claim , and the resolution of king lewis 's doubts all plainly derive from the female .
the sin upon my head , dread sovereign , for in the book of numbers is it writ : when the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter .
for it is written in the book of numbers : when the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter .
invoke his warlike spirit and your great - uncle 's , edward the black prince , who on the french ground played a tragedy , making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion 's whelp forage in blood of french nobility .
invoke his warlike spirit and that of edward the black prince , your great - uncle , who fought a tragic battle on french soil , routing the french army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of french noblemen .

this the dauphin speaks .
this is the dauphin 's message .
when we have matched our rackets to these balls , we will in france , by god 's grace , play a set shall strike his father 's crown into the hazard .
once i 've put my rackets to these balls , i 'll play a set in france , god willing , that will knock his father 's crown right out of the court .
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbed with chases .
but tell the dauphin i will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of france .
and tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it .
and tell the dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
convey them with safe conduct .

they sell the pasture now to buy the horse , following the mirror of all christian kings with wingd heels , as english mercurys .
in the minds of harry and his followers , visions of the kingdoms , spoils , and titles to be won eclipse thoughts of actual fighting .
, confirmed conspiracy with fearful france , and by their hands this grace of kings must die , if hell and treason hold their promises ,
the gracious king will die by their hands in southampton before he sets sail for france if hell and treason have their way .
for my part , i care not .
but that 's as it may be .
it will toast cheese , and it will endure cold as another man 's sword will , and there 's an end .
it 's good enough to toast cheese , and it will survive cold as well as another man 's sword .

how about it , corporal nym ?
men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .
men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
there must be conclusions .
well , it 's not for me to say .
come , shall i make you two friends ?
come on , can i get you two to make up ?
why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another 's throats ?
we have to go to france together : why should we cut each other 's throats ?
that 's mercy , but too much security .
he should be punished , your majesty .
my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter , we will aboard tonight .

what see you in those papers , that you lose so much complexion ?
what 's in those papers that makes you change color ?
the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
the mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
see you , my princes and my noble peers , these english monsters .
princes and noble peers , take a look at these english monsters .
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels , that knew'st the very bottom of my soul , that almost mightst have coined me into gold , wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger ?
you who had access to all my thoughts , who knew me to the inmost part of my soul , who could have had any amount of gold from me if you 'd needed it and only asked me : is it possible that a foreign power could find in you even enough evil to injure one of my fingers ?
't is so strange that , though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , i can scarcely believe it , it 's so past understanding .
but thou , 'gainst all proportion , didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder , and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence .
the demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion , could return to hell and tell the devil 's legions , i will never win another soul as easily as i won that englishman 's .
show men dutiful ?

and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full - fraught man and best endued with some suspicion .
your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
touching our person , seek we no revenge , but we our kingdom 's safety must so tender , whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws we do deliver you .
i seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do i hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .

therefore the dukes of berri , bretagne , brabant , and orlans shall advance , and you , prince dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
and let us do it with no show of fear , no , with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morris - dance .
let 's do it with no show of anxiety no , with no more fear than if we 'd heard that the english were busying themselves with folk dancing .
for , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , her scepter so fantastically borne by a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , that fear attends her not .
because , my good king , england is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she 's hardly a threat .

you are completely wrong about this king .
well , 't is not so , my lord high constable .
well , you 're wrong , my lord high constable .
so the proportions of defense are filled , which of a weak or niggardly projection doth , like a miser , spoil his coat with scanting a little cloth .

crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , french youth whose fathers and god had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
to that end , as matching to his youth and vanity , i did present him with the paris balls .
to that end , i presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .

he 'll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of europe .

for what male subject is there old enough for his chin to be graced with even one hair who does n't want to follow this select band of hand - picked knights to france ?
work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .

my father compounded with my mother under the dragon 's tail and my nativity was under ursa major , so that it follows i am rough and lecherous .
my father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and i was born under the big dipper , so it 's inevitable that i 'm rude and oversexed .
fut , i should have been that i am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .

if she must teem , create her child of spleen , that it may live and be a thwart disnatured torment to her .
if she must give birth , make her child a bad seed who will torment her , give her a forehead wrinkled with worry , make her cry until her cheeks are sunken .

i 'll speak a prophecy ere i go .
i 'll recite a prophecy before i go .
when priests are more in word than matter , when brewers mar their malt with water , when nobles are their tailors ' tutors , no heretics burned but wenches ' suitors , when every case in law is right , no squire in debt nor no poor knight , when slanders do not live in tongues , nor cutpurses come not to throngs , when usurers tell their gold i ' th ' field , and bawds and whores do churches build then shall the realm of albion come to great confusion .
one day , when priests do n't practice what they preach , when brewers dilute their beer with water , when noblemen teach their tailors how to sew , when instead of heretics being burned at the stake , lovers are burned by syphilis , when every law case is tried fairly , when no gentleman is in debt , when no one slanders anyone else , and thieves do n't snatch wallets in crowds , when moneylenders count their gold in the open air , and pimps and whores build fine churches then the kingdom of england will come to ruin .
this prophecy merlin shall make , for i live before his time .
and whoever lives to see that day will walk with his feet .

and in my conscience , my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience , to offer to counsel me to stay with the jew .
certainly the jew is the devil incarnate , and my conscience is giving me a hard time by telling me to stay with the jew .

and twenty of these puny lies i 'll tell , that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth .
i 'll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think i graduated from school at least a year ago .
fie , what a question 's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
if i had a dirty mind , i 'd think you meant turning to men for sex .

i 've told you what i intend to do , and i 've sworn by the holy sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
if you deny it , let the danger light upon your charter and your city 's freedom .
if you refuse to allow me to do so , your city 's charter and its freedom are endangered .
you 'll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats .
you 're going to ask me why i 'd rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
i 'll not answer that but say it is my humour .
let 's just say it 's because i feel like it .
what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned ?
what if i had a rat in my house , and i felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
what , are you answered yet ?
do you have your answer yet ?
you may as well do anything most hard , as seek to soften that than which what 's harder ?
you might as well tell the pine trees on the mountain to stop waving their treetops when the storms blow through them .
why sweat they under burdens ?
should i say to you , set them free !
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasoned with such viands ?
let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you ?
you will answer , the slaves are ours .
and that 's just how i 'm answering you .
the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought .
the pound of flesh that i want from him was very expensive .
't is mine and i will have it .
it 's mine and i 'm going to get it .
meantime the court shall hear bellario 's letter .
in the meantime , i 'll read bellario 's letter out loud .
his name is balthazar .
his name is balthazar .
i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant .
i told him about the case of the jew and antonio the merchant , and we consulted many books together .
i leave him to your gracious acceptance , whose trial shall better publish his commendation .
i 'm sending him in my place to answer your request for someone to act as judge in this matter .
come you from old bellario ?
did old bellario send you here ?

we pray for mercy , and this same prayer teaches us to show mercy to others as well .
grieve not that i am fall'n to this for you , for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom .
speak well of me after i 'm dead , and when the tale 's done , ask her to judge whether bassanio had a friend .
repent but you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt .
be sad only at the fact that you 'll lose your friend your friend does n't regret that he paid your debt .
mark , jew , a learnd judge !
pay attention , jew .
i take this offer then : pay the bond thrice and let the christian go .
pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the christian go .

it is enacted in the laws of venice , if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods .
the laws of venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner 's goods .
down , therefore , and beg mercy of the duke .
so get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
i want you to see the difference between us , so i pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
for half thy wealth , it is antonio 's .
half of your wealth goes to antonio .
two things provided more : that for this favor he presently become a christian ; the other , that he do record a gift here in the court , of all he dies possessed , unto his son lorenzo and his daughter .
if the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property , i 'm happy , as long as he lets me have the other half in trust , to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter .
take some remembrance of us as a tribute , not as a fee .
take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
his ring i do accept most thankfully .
i ca n't have dinner with him .
furthermore , i pray you show my youth old shylock 's house .
and could you please take my servant to old shylock 's house ?

in faith , i gave it to the judge 's clerk .
i gave it to the judge 's clerk .
about a hoop of gold , a paltry ring that she did give me , whose posy was for all the world like cutler 's poetry upon a knife , love me and leave me not .
we 're arguing about a hoop of gold , a cheap little ring she gave me , that had a little inscription on it , nothing more than a knife - maker 's attempt at poetry .
though not for me , yet for your vehement oaths , you should have been respective and have kept it .
you swore to me when i gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
the clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it .
and now you claim you gave it to a judge 's clerk !
i could not for my heart deny it him .
i did n't have the heart to say no to him .
if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honor to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring .
if you 'd known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you would n't have let it go .
what man is there so much unreasonable , if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal , wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ?
who would be so unreasonable as to insist on taking the ring if you 'd defended it with any kind of zeal ?
nerissa teaches me what to believe .
nerissa 's got the right idea .
i 'll die for 't but some woman had the ring .
i 'll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
give him this , and bid him keep it better than the other .
and tell him to hold on to it better than the other one .
ay , and i 'll give them him without a fee .
yes , and i 'll give it to him for free .

demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
demetrius is an admirable man .
examine well your blood whether , if you yield not to your father 's choice , you can endure the livery of a nun , for aye to be in shady cloister mewed , to live a barren sister all your life , chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon .
then decide whether you could stand to be a nun , wearing a priestess 's habit and caged up in a cloister forever , living your entire life without a husband or children , weakly chanting hymns to the cold and virginal goddess of the moon .
but earthlier happy is the rose distilled than that which , withering on the virgin thorn , grows , lives , and dies in single blessedness .

demetrius and i 'll say this to his face courted nedar 's daughter , helena , and made her fall in love with him .
i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof , but being overfull of self - affairs , my mind did lose it .
i have to admit i 've heard something about that , and meant to ask demetrius about it , but i was too busy with personal matters and it slipped my mind .
i have some private schooling for you both .
i want to say a few things to you in private .
come , my hippolyta .
come with me , hippolyta .
demetrius and egeus , go along .
demetrius and egeus , come with us .
i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
i want you to do some things for our wedding , and i also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
a good persuasion .
so here 's the plan .
my ear should catch your voice .
did you just call me beautiful ?
my tongue should catch your tongue 's sweet melody .
i would catch your good looks before i left .
were the world mine , demetrius being bated , the rest i 'd give to be to you translated .
if the world were mine , i 'd give it all up everything except demetrius to be you .
and good luck grant thee thy demetrius !
pray for us , and i hope you win over demetrius !

we will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
we 'll be there , and there we 'll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .

the king doth keep his revels here tonight .
the king 's having a party here tonight .
for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she , as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king .
just make sure the queen does n't come anywhere near him , because king oberon is extremely angry .
and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild .
he wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
either i mistake your shape and making quite , or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite called robin goodfellow .
unless i 'm mistaken , you 're that mischievous and naughty spirit named robin goodfellow .
those that hobgoblin call you , and sweet puck , you do their work , and they shall have good luck .
some people call you hobgoblin and sweet puck , and you 're nice to them .
thou speak'st aright .
what you say is true .
i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean - fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal .
sometimes a wise old woman with a sad story to tell tries to sit down on me , thinking i 'm a three - legged stool .
here comes oberon .
here comes oberon .
therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs , which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents .
and because you interrupt us so that we ca n't dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
the ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
so all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
the nine - men's - morris is filled up with mud , and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable .
sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
therefore the moon , the governess of floods , pale in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound .
it 's not winter here for the human mortals , so they 're not protected by the holy hymns and carols that they sing in winter .
and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension .
so the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
we are their parents and original .
and this is all because of our argument .
the fairyland buys not the child of me .
i wo n't give up this child for all of fairyland .
a certain aim he took at a fair vestal thrond by the west , and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts .
he took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
it fell upon a little western flower , before milk - white , now purple with love 's wound .
it fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
and maidens call it love - in - idleness .
young girls call it love - in - idleness .
fetch me that flower .
bring me that flower .
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees .
if its juice is put on someone 's eyelids while they 're asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
fetch me this herb , and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league .
bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
having once this juice , i 'll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes .
when i have the juice of that flower , i 'll trickle some drops of it on titania 's eyes while she 's sleeping .
the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love .
she 'll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up even if it 's a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
use me but as your spaniel spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me .
treat me like you would treat a dog kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?
so how can anyone say i 'm alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
the wildest hath not such a heart as you .
the wildest animal is n't as cruel as you are .
fie , demetrius !
shame on you , demetrius !
i pray thee , give it me .
please , give it to me .
be it so , lysander .
let 's do that , lysander .
lysander riddles very prettily .
lysander 's got a way with words .
such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid .
i would certainly be rude and shameful if i had implied that you were a liar .
but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve this flower 's force in stirring love .
i 've been through the entire forest , but i have n't found any athenian man to use the flower on .
and here the maiden , sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground .
and here 's the girl , sleeping soundly on the damp and dirty ground .
when thou wakest , let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid .
lysander jerk , i throw all the power of this magic charm on your eyes .
so awake when i am gone , for i must now to oberon .
wake up when i 'm gone , because now i have to go to oberon .
oh , i am out of breath in this fond chase .
the more i pray , the less i get out of it .
how came her eyes so bright ?
how did her eyes get so bright ?
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia 's sphery eyne ?
what evil and deceitful mirror made me think i could rival hermia 's starry eyes ?
lysander , on the ground ?
lysander , on the ground ?
do not say so , lysander .
do n't say that , lysander .
what though he love your hermia ?
why do you care that he loves hermia ?
yet hermia still loves you .
hermia still loves you , so be happy .
things growing are not ripe until their season .
fruits and vegetables do n't ripen until the right season of the year .
perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness .
i have to tell you , i thought you were a much kinder person than this .
and all my powers , address your love and might to honor helen and to be her knight .
she does n't see hermia hermia , keep sleeping , and do n't come near me ever again !

lysander , lord !
lysander , my lord !
alack , where are you ?

i 'll find you or die right away .
and here 's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
let 's put on our play exactly as we 'll perform it for the duke .
not a whit .
not at all !
and for the more better assurance , tell them that i , pyramus , am not pyramus , but bottom the weaver .
and to make it even clearer , we can tell them that i 'm playing pyramus but i 'm not really pyramus really , i 'm bottom the weaver .
and he himself must speak through , saying thus or to the same defect ladies , or fair ladies , i would wish you or i would request you or i would entreat you not to fear , not to tremble , my life for yours .
he should say the following , or something else to the same ladies , or lovely ladies , i would like to ask you or i would like to request of you or i would like to beg you not to be afraid , and not to tremble with fear .
and there indeed let him name his name , and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner .
and then he should say his name , and tell them plainly that he 's snug the carpenter .
for , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
because , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
for pyramus and thisbe , says the story , did talk through the chink of a wall .
but there 's still another problem : we need to have a wall in the big hall , because according to the story , pyramus and thisbe talked through a little hole in a wall .
come , sit down , every mother 's son , and rehearse your parts .
now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts pyramus , you start .
what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?
who are these country bumpkins swaggering around so close to where the fairy queen is sleeping ?
i 'll meet thee , pyramus , at ninny 's tomb .
i 'll meet you , pyramus , at ninny 's grave .
we are haunted .
we 're being haunted .
i 'll follow you .

and i 'll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
thou art translated .
you 've been changed .
but i will not stir from this place , do what they can .
they want to make an ass of me , to scare me if they can .
therefore go with me .
so come with me .

tie up my love 's tongue .
the moon looks sad to me .
when in that moment so it came to pass , titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
at that exact moment , titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden 's patience .
from now on i wo n't even consider you a human being .
an adder did it , for with doubler tongue than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
a snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
there is no following her in this fierce vein .
i ca n't go after her when she 's in a rage like this .
then fate o'errules that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath .
for every man who 's faithful to his true love , a million end up running after a different lover .
lord , what fools these mortals be !
lord , what fools these mortals are !
weigh oath with oath , and you will nothing weigh .
the promises you 're making to me belong to hermia .
o helena , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine !
oh helena , you goddess , you divine and perfect nymph !
crystal is muddy .
crystal is n't as clear as they are .
oh , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow !
oh , your lips are as ripe as a pair of tempting cherries touching each other !
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment .
if you had any manners at all , you would n't treat me like this .
you are unkind , demetrius .
do n't be cruel , demetrius .
lysander , keep thy hermia .
lysander , keep your hermia .
disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest to thy peril thou aby it dear .
do n't insult a deep love that you do n't understand , or you 'll pay the price .
now i perceive they have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport , in spite of me .
now i see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
all schooldays ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
we , hermia , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key , as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporate .
we used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles , sewing it on one piece of cloth , sitting on the same cushion , singing one song in the same key , as if our hands , our sides , our voices and our minds were stuck together .
so we grew together , like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries molded on one stem ;
we grew together like twin cherries which seemed to be separate but were also together two lovely cherries on one stem .
and made your other love , demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , precious , celestial ?
have n't you made your other love , demetrius who kicked me with his foot not long ago call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
this you should pity rather than despise .
why does he talk like that to a girl he ca n't stand ?
lysander what , can you do me greater harm than hate ?
lysander can you hurt me any more than by saying you hate me ?
hate me ?
hate me ?
am not i hermia ?
am i not hermia ?
are not you lysander ?
are n't you lysander ?
i am as fair now as i was erewhile .
you still loved me when we fell asleep , but when you woke up you left me .
yet since night you left me .
so you left me oh , god help me !
be certain , nothing truer .
i hate you and love helena .
helena you juggler !
helena you trickster , you snake !
you canker - blossom !
you thief !
have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ?
you 're going to make me mad enough to answer you ?
you counterfeit , you puppet , you !
damn you , you faker , you puppet !
puppet ?
puppet ?
how low am i , thou painted maypole ?
so how short am i , you painted barber pole ?
how low am i ?
how short am i ?
he followed you .
he followed you .
but he hath chid me hence and threatened me to strike me , spurn me nay , to kill me too .
but he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me even kill me .
hie therefore , robin , overcast the night .
hurry up , robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron , and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another 's way .
cover the sky with a low - hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they ca n't run into each other .
and sometime rail thou like demetrius .
imitate lysander 's voice and egg demetrius on with insults .
and from each other look thou lead them thus , till o'er their brows death - counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep .
the flower 's juice has the power to erase all the damage that 's been done to his eyes , and to make him see normally , the way he used to .
whiles i in this affair do thee employ , i 'll to my queen and beg her indian boy .
while you 're busy with that , i 'll go see queen titania and ask her once again for the indian boy .
for night 's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast , and yonder shines aurora 's harbinger , at whose approach , ghosts , wandering here and there , troop home to churchyards .
the souls of people who were n't buried in holy ground , but instead lie rotting by the side of the road or at the bottom of a river , have already gone back to their wormy graves .
nay , then , thou mock'st me .
no , you 're just taunting me .
shine comforts from the east , that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest .
i wish the comforting light of day would shine so i can go back to athens and get away from these people who hate me so much .
heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray !
if they do fight , i hope lysander is safe !
on the ground sleep sound .
sleep well there on the ground .
and the country proverb known that every man should take his own in your waking shall be shown .

and , good monsieur , bring me the honey bag .
i 'd hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
welcome , good robin .
welcome , good robin .
seest thou this sweet sight ?
do you see this sweet sight ?
for , meeting her of late behind the wood , seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool , i did upbraid her and fall out with her .
i ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and i scolded her and argued with her .
for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , and that same dew , which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail .
she had put a wreath of fresh , fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead , and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass .
and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes .
and now that i have the boy , i 'll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
but first i will release the fairy queen .
but first i 'll release the fairy queen from the spell .
now , my titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
now , titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
i do hear the morning lark .
i can hear the lark singing .
go , one of you , find out the forester .
one of you go find the forest ranger .
uncouple in the western valley .
unleash the dogs in the western valley .
let them go .
let them go .
a cry more tunable was never hollaed to , nor cheered with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly .
they have the same folds of flesh around their mouths , the same sandy - colored fur , and hanging ears that brush the morning dew off the grass .
theseus enough , enough , my lord .
theseus enough , enough , my lord .
but like in sickness did i loathe this food .
i was engaged to her before i ever met hermia .
no , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens .
he 's quite simply the smartest working - man in athens .
i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys .
i 'll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp .
the battle between hercules and the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch , accompanied by a harp .
that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules .
i 've already told that story to hippolyta , while praising my cousin hercules .
the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , tearing the thracian singer in their rage .

well , if ever thou dost fall from this faith , thou wilt prove a notable argument .
i 'll be sure to remember this fuss you 've made , in case you ever do fall in love .
if thou dost love fair hero , cherish it , and i will break with her and with her father , and thou shalt have her .
i will speak to her and her father about the matter , and i 'll convince leonato to promise hero to you .
how sweetly you do minister to love , that know love 's grief by his complexion !
you can see that i 'm sick with love , and you 're taking care of me in just the right way !
but lest my liking might too sudden seem , i would have salved it with a longer treatise .
but i did n't want you to think that i 'm hasty in my emotions .
what need the bridge much broader than the flood ?

it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
you need to act carefully if you 're going to stay in his good graces .
i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog ; therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage .
it suits me more to be hated by everyone than to put on a fancy show and trick people into loving me .
in the meantime , let me be that i am , and seek not to alter me .
until that happens , let me be who i am and do n't try to change me .
which way looks he ?
he 's a very fancy gentleman .
i whipped me behind the arras , and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself , and having obtained her , give her to count claudio .
i quickly hid behind a tapestry and heard them agree that the prince would court hero tonight at the dance and , once he won her consent to marry , would give her to claudio .

amen .
amen .

i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
i told him and i think i was telling the truth that you had won the lady 's heart .
o , she misused me past the endurance of a block !
not even a block of wood could handle her abuses !
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her .
even my mask seemed to come to life in order to argue with her .
she speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
she speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
i would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed .
if her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
so indeed all disquiet , horror and perturbation follows her .
i would n't marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .

he lent it to me once , and i paid him back with interest : a double heart for his single one .

i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
i knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet .
i knew him when he would 've walked ten miles to see a well - crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster , but i 'll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool .
i ca n't promise that love wo n't transform me , but i can promise you this : until i truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
ha !
ha !
i will hide me in the arbor .

o , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her .
oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
this can be no trick .
this ca n't be a trick .
it seems her affections have their full bent .
they say i 'll be smug if i find out she loves me .
why , it must be requited !
i never thought i 'd marry .
i hear how i am censured .
i ca n't appear to be proud .
and wise , but for loving me ; by my troth , it is no addition to her wit , nor no great argument of her folly , for i will be horribly in love with her !
that may not be any proof of her intelligence , but i swear it wo n't be evidence of her stupidity for i 'm going to be horribly in love with her !
a man loves the meat in his youth that he can not endure in his age .
a man can love a dish when he is young that he hates when he turns old .
shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor ?
will quips and clever remarks and scathing written words keep a man from getting what his heart desires ?
no !
no !
when i said i would die a bachelor , i did not think i should live till i were married .

here comes beatrice .
here comes beatrice .
good margaret , run thee to the parlor .
margaret , run into the sitting room .
there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio .
you 'll find beatrice there , talking to claudio and the prince .
whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse is all of her .
whisper to her that ursula and i are walking in the orchard and that we 're talking all about her .
now begin , for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground , to hear our conference .
see , beatrice has run over like a little bird , keeping close to the ground and trying to overhear us .
so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth .
if he 's tall , she 'll say he 's a spear topped by an odd head ; if he 's short , she says he looks like a badly carved miniature .
therefore let benedick , like covered fire , consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
like a fire that gets covered up , benedick should smother his love and waste away .
there is no appearance of fancy in him , unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises , as to be a dutchman today , a frenchman tomorrow , or in the shape of two countries at once , as a german from the waist downward , all slops , and a spaniard from the hip upward , no doublet .
he 's a dutchman today , a frenchman tomorrow , and sometimes wears the clothing of two countries at once : a german from the waist down , with his baggy pants , and a spaniard from the hips up , with a cloak and no jacket .
if you will follow me , i will show you enough , and when you have seen more and heard more , proceed accordingly .

is not marriage honorable in a beggar ?
and is n't your husband an honorable man ?
i think you would have me say , saving your reverence , a husband .
what 's wrong with admitting your husband 's going to lie on you ?
an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking , i 'll offend nobody .
nothing , as long as it 's the right husband with the right wife .
no , by my troth , i have no moral meaning .
no , honestly , there 's no other meaning .

goodman verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .

farewell , thou pure impiety and impious purity .
goodbye to your pure wickedness and your wicked purity .
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
why did you once seem lovely to me ?
confirmed , confirmed !
then it 's confirmed !
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find , awaked in such a kind , both strength of limb and policy of mind , ability in means and choice of friends , to quit me of them throughly .
age has n't dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much , and luck has n't robbed me of so much of my fortune , and my bad ways have n't deprived me of so many friends , that they wo n't find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally , with money and friends at my disposal .

princes and counties !
princes and counts !
surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , count comfect , a sweet gallant , surely !

but manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too .
their manliness has melted into pretty curtsies and fancy manners , and their bravery is spent on making clever compliments .
he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it .

don pedro my lord , your brother john is ta'en in flight and brought with armed men back to messina .
don pedro my lord , your brother john was caught by armed soldiers as he fled .
and what was he ?
and who does he choose ?
mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership .
his military understanding is all theory , no practice .
for , sir , it is as sure as you are roderigo , were i the moor , i would not be iago .
you , as sure as your name 's roderigo , if i were the moor i would n't want to be iago .
heaven is my judge , not i for love and duty , but seeming so , for my peculiar end .
i may seem to love and obey him , but in fact , i 'm just serving him to get what i want .
for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern , 't is not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at .
if my outward appearance started reflecting what i really felt , soon enough i 'd be wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at .
zounds , sir , you 're robbed !
for god 's sake , sir , you 've been robbed .
for shame , put on your gown .
your heart 's going to break .
even now , now , very now , an old black ram is tupping your white ewe .
wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee .
i 've already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .
but if you did n't know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
if she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you .
if you did n't allow your daughter to do what she 's doing , then she 's rebelling against you .
( roderigo farewell , for i must leave you .
roderigo it 's time for me to say goodbye to you .
call up my brother oh , would you had had her !
do you know where we can find her and the moor ?
it is brabantio .
it 's brabantio .
were it my cue to fight , i should have known it without a prompter .
i do n't need anyone to tell me when to fight .
whither will you that i go to answer this your charge ?
where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
the duke in council ?
the duke 's in a meeting ?
and mine , two hundred .
and mine say two hundred .
we lacked your counsel and your help tonight .
i could have used your wisdom and help tonight .
what drugs , what charms , what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter .
story of how we fell in love , and what drugs , charms , spells , and powerful magic because that 's what i 'm being accused of i used to win his daughter .
against all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be .
you 'd have to be stupid to think that someone so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that .
she swore , in faith , 't was strange , 't was passing strange , 't was pitiful , 't was wondrous pitiful .
she thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she 'd fall in love with him .
upon this hint i spake .
i took the hint and spoke to her .
this only is the witchcraft i have used .
that 's the only witchcraft i ever used .
so let the turk of cyprus us beguile , we lose it not , so long as we can smile .
so if the turks steal cyprus from us , it wo n't be bad as long as we keep smiling .
but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that , to pay grief , must of poor patience borrow .
but i 've lost something precious , and i have to put up with the platitude as well as suffering my loss .
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus .
the turks are heading for cyprus with a powerful fleet .
you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist'rous expedition .
so i 'll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriage celebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition .
i saw othello 's visage in his mind , and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate .
if i were left at home uselessly while he went off to war , then i 'm separated from my husband in his natural element .
let me go with him .
let me go with him .
our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .
our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
put money in thy purse .
here 's what you 'll do .
when she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice .
when she 's had enough of the moor 's body , she 'll realize her mistake .
if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
if you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
therefore make money .
raise all the money you can .
a pox of drowning thyself !
and to hell with drowning yourself !
thou art sure of me .
you can trust me .
go , make money .
go get money .
we will have more of this tomorrow .
we 'll speak again tomorrow .
to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery .
get his position and use him to hurt othello at the same time ?
michael cassio , lieutenant to the warlike moor othello , is come on shore .
michael cassio , lieutenant of the moor othello , has arrived on shore .
pray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
let 's go to the shore to get a look at the ship that came in , and to look out for othello 's ship .
i find it still , when i have leave to sleep .
she 's always talking when i want to sleep .
come on , come on .
come on , come on .
i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise .
i 'm just trying not to show how worried i am about othello 's safety .
come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
come on , what would you say about me ?
come , let us to the castle .
let 's go up to the castle .
our wars are done , the turks are drowned .
the war 's over and the turks are drowned .
i prithee , good iago , go to the bay and disembark my coffers .
iago , would you be good enough to go get my trunks from the ships ?
bring thou the master to the citadel .
and bring the ship 's captain to the castle .
come , desdemona , once more , well met at cyprus .
i 'll say it again : i 'm so happy to see you here in cyprus !
do thou meet me presently at the harbor .
meet me down at the harbor .
i can not believe that in her .
she 's not that kind of woman .
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
you could tell by how they were acting that they 're going to be lovers .
but , sir , be you ruled by me .
but listen to me ; let me guide you .
i have brought you from venice .
i brought you here from venice .
i 'll not be far from you .
i 'll put you in charge .
provoke him that he may .
try to get him to do that .
that cassio loves her , i do well believe 't .
i 'll say bad things about him to the moor .
or , failing so , yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure .
i 'll make the moor thank me , love me , and reward me , even though the joke will be on him the whole time .
bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello !
god bless the island of cyprus and our noble general othello !
tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with you .
come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can .
oh , sweet england !
oh , sweet england !
the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
the lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
forgive us our sins !
god forgive our sins !
i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
i can stand well enough , and i can speak just fine .
how now , roderigo ?
roderigo ) hello , roderigo .
lieutenant sir , montano help , masters !
no , lieutenant god , gentlemen help lieutenant sir , montano help , men !
the general speaks to you .
the general is talking to you !
for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .
for heaven 's sake , stop this savage brawl !
i do not know .
i do n't know .
friends all but now , even now , in quarter , and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed .
we were all having fun until just a minute ago ; we were as happy as a bride and groom taking off their clothes .
worthy montano , you were wont be civil .
montano , you 're supposed to be calm and collected .
give me answer to it .
you 're famous for it .
worthy othello , i am hurt to danger .
othello , i 've been seriously hurt .
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio .
i 'd rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about michael cassio .
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .
this gentleman stopped cassio and told him to put away his sword .
montano sir , for your hurts myself will be your surgeon .
montano i 'll see to it personally that your wounds are treated .
you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
a reputation is a useless and fake quality that others impose on us .
she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
she is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it 's wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
and what 's he then that says i play the villain ?
who can say i 'm evil when my advice is so good ?
she 's framed as fruitful as the free elements .
that 's really the best way to win the moor back again .
dull not device by coldness and delay .
now two things still need to be done .
i have made bold , iago , to send in to your wife .
i 'm going to ask her to let me talk to desdemona .
i shall not dine at home , i meet the captains at the citadel .
i 'll be meeting the captains at the citadel .
why , then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morn .
well then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morning .
on tuesday noon , or night , or wednesday morn .
or tuesday noon or at night , or wednesday morning .
tell me , othello .
tell me , othello .
trust me , i could do much
i swear , i could do so much
nay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted .
if i ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it 'll be something difficult and terrible .
emilia , come .
come here , emilia .
you can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst 't is in my custody .
you ca n't find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you could n't make me tell you .
it is the green - eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on .
it 's a green - eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
no !
no .
exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blowed surmises , matching thy inference .
i might as well be a goat if i ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions you 're implying .
't is not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances .
if you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you 're not making me jealous .
my lord , i would i might entreat your honor to scan this thing no farther .
but keep him away for a while , and you 'll see how he goes about getting it back .
this fellow 's of exceeding honesty and knows all quantities , with a learnd spirit , of human dealings .
if it turns out that she really is running around on me , i 'll send her away , even though it 'll break my heart .
i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ' uses .
i 'd rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone i love , sharing the rest of her with others .
wooed me to steal it , but she so loves the token ( for he conjured her she should ever keep it ) that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to .
but she loves it so much ( since othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
i 'll have the work ta'en out and give 't iago .
i 'll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to iago .
go , leave me .
now go , leave me .
i will in cassio 's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it .
i 'll leave this handkerchief at cassio 's house and let him find it .
oh , heaven forgive me !
oh , heaven help me !
god buy you , take mine office .
do n't you have any sense at all ?
i thank you for this profit , and from hence i 'll love no friend , sith love breeds such offence .
from now on , i 'll never try to help a friend when it hurts him so much to hear the truth .
i should be wise , for honesty 's a fool and loses that it works for .
honesty 's stupid , it makes me lose my friends even when i 'm trying to help them .
there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter
i recently shared a bed with cassio , and i could n't sleep because of a raging toothache .
oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
oh , i 'd kill that bastard cassio forty thousand times if i could !
within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio 's not alive .
within the next three days i want to hear you tell me that cassio 's dead .
much castigation , exercise devout , for here 's a young and sweating devil here , that commonly rebels .
someone with a young sweating hand like this one is bound to act up sooner or later .
she , dying , gave it me and bid me , when my fate would have me wived , to give it her .
she told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her .
to lose 't or give 't away were such perdition as nothing else could match .
when she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when i got married .
there is no other way .
there 's no other way .
go and importune her .
go ahead and ask her .
my lord is not my lord , nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered .
god knows i have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
let that suffice you .
let that be enough for you .
nay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal .
we should n't expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
cassio , walk hereabout .
i 'll go look for him cassio , stay around here .
if i do find him fit , i 'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost .
if he 's in a good mood i 'll mention you again , and do everything i can .
sweet bianca , desdemona take me this work out .
when i get some free time i 'll make it up to you .
i like the work well .
i found it in my room .
ere it be demanded , as like enough it will , i would have it copied .
someone is certainly looking for it , and i 'll have to give it back .
but for the handkerchief
but a handkerchief
lie with her ?
in bed with her ?
lie on her ?
on top of her ?
handkerchief confessions handkerchief !
handkerchief confessions handkerchief !
noses , ears , and lips .
noses , ears , lips .
is 't possible ?
is it possible ?
my lord !
my lord ?
othello !
my lord , othello !
would you would bear your fortune like a man !
i wish you could face your bad news like a man !
there 's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar .
millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them , wrongly believing they belong to them alone .
whilst you were here o'erwhelmd with your grief a passion most resulting such a man cassio came hither .
while you were dazed by grief which is n't appropriate for a man like you cassio showed up here .
marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .
but stay calm , and do n't get carried away by rage , or i 'll think you 're not a man .
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me .
it does n't make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant .
i marry her !
me , marry her ?
do not think it so unwholesome .
please give me a little credit !
ha , ha , ha !
ha , ha , ha !
this is the monkey 's own giving out .
the little monkey must have started that rumor herself .
she was here even now .
she was here just now .
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
but i ca n't see the dog i 'm going to throw it to .
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
what did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
i must take out the work ?
i was an idiot to take it !
so delicate with her needle , an admirable musician .
she 's so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
o iago , the pity of it , iago !
oh , it 's dreadful , dreadful , iago !
i warrant something from venice .
i think someone 's coming from venice .
is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ?
is this the same moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
strike his wife ?
hitting his wife ?
you shall observe him , and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech .
his own actions will show you what kind of person he is , so i wo n't have to bother telling you .
do but go after and mark how he continues .
just go after him and watch what he does next .
your true and loyal wife .
i 'm your wife , your true and loyal wife .
o thou weed , who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
you 're like a weed pretending to be a flower , so beautiful and sweet - smelling that i ache when i look at you .
what committed ?
what have you done ?
o thou public commoner !
what have you done ?
what committed ?
what have you done ?
there 's money for your pains .
you 're in charge of this hell !
how do you , madam ?
how are you , madam ?
do not talk to me , emilia .
do n't talk to me , emilia .
prithee , tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets .
tonight put my wedding sheets on my bed , and tell your husband to come to me now .
why should he call her whore ?
why should he call her a whore ?
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love .
unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it 'll never destroy my love .
to do the act that might the addition earn not the world 's mass of vanity could make me .
i would n't do the thing that would make me a whore for all the money in the world .
the business of the state does him offence , and he does chide with you .

if i were in england now , like i was once , and i had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead indian .

the elements of whom your swords are tempered may as well wound the loud winds or with bemocked - at stabs kill the still - closing waters as diminish one dowl that 's in my plume .
alonso , antonio , sebastian the three of you are sinners , and destiny made the sea belch you up onto this island where no men live , since none of you deserve to live .
my fellow ministers are like invulnerable .
my two companions are just as invulnerable as i am .
if you could hurt , your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted .
even if you had the power to hurt us , you 'd find your swords far too heavy to lift .
but remember for that 's my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero , exposed unto the sea , which hath requit it , him and his innocent child .
but remember and it 's my job to remind you of this that in milan the three of you stole prospero 's throne and threw him and his innocent child into the sea , which has now taken revenge on you .
for which foul deed the powers delaying , not forgetting have incensed the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , against your peace .
to punish you for this horrible crime , the higher powers delaying their punishment , not forgetting about it have stirred up the seas and all the creatures of earth against you .

i thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared prospero 's name .
therefore my son i ' th ' ooze is bedded , and i 'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded and with him there lie mudded .
i 'll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .

now you all have got the power to keep me prisoner here , or send me off to naples .
now i want spirits to enforce , art to enchant , and my ending is despair , unless i be relieved by prayer , which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults .
now i have no spirits to enslave , no magic to cast spells , and i 'll end up in despair unless i 'm relieved by prayer , which wins over god himself and absolves all sins .
oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , that breathes upon a bank of violets , stealing and giving odor .
oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical .
love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers .
i need a beautiful place to sit and think about love .
i prithee and i 'll pay thee bounteously conceal me what i am , and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent .

wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
why do n't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
my very walk should be a jig .
you 're a born dancer .
viola stand you a while aloof .
viola cesario , i want a word with you .
diana 's lip is not more smooth and rubious .
anyone who says you 're a man must not notice how young you are .
i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair .
your lips are as smooth and red as the goddess diana 's .
viola prosper well in this , and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord , to call his fortunes thine .
your soft voice is like a young girl 's , high and clear , and the rest of you is pretty feminine too .
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
and would n't that be as bad for you as being killed ?
better a witty fool , than a foolish wit .
ah yes , a witty fool 's better than a foolish wit .
two faults , madonna , that drink and good counsel will amend .
if you hand a drink to a sober fool , he wo n't be thirsty anymore .
if he mend , he is no longer dishonest .
if he can not , let the tailor mend him .
anything that 's mended is but patched .
anything that 's mended is only patched up .
as there is no true cuckold but calamity , so beauty 's a flower .
a good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
misprision in the highest degree !
please let me prove you 're a fool .
to be generous , guiltless , and of free disposition is to take those things for bird - bolts that you deem cannon - bullets .
if you were generous , innocent , and good - natured , you would n't get so upset by what the fool says .
now mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
i hope the god of deception rewards you by making you a wonderful liar .
i defy lechery .
i defy brain - death !
go look after him .
go take care of him .
of what personage and years is he ?
what does he look like ?
he is very well - favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
he 's very handsome and speaks well , but he 's very young .
it is the more like to be feigned .
that means it 's more likely to be fake .
i heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you .
i heard you were rude when you were standing outside my gate , and that 's the only reason i let you in .
what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead .
if i seemed rude , it 's because of how badly i was treated when i got here .
to any other 's , profanation .
who i am and what i want are a secret .
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
but i 'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
my lord and master loves you .
i see what you 're like .
oh , such love could be but recompensed though you were crowned the nonpareil of beauty .
you should return a love as deep as his , even if you 're the most beautiful woman in the world .
your lord does know my mind .
i 'm sure he 's a very nice man .
halloo your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out olivia !

who are your parents ?
i am a gentleman .
i 'm a gentleman .
i 'll be sworn thou art ; thy tongue , thy face , thy limbs , actions , and spirit , do give thee fivefold blazon .
your way of talking , your face , your body , your behavior , and your sensitive soul all prove you 're a gentleman .
what ho , malvolio !
malvolio !
it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you .
my luck is pretty bad right now , and it might rub off on you .
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in .
but i know you 'd never force me to tell you things i do n't want to , so i should be polite and tell you what i can .
you must know of me then , antonio , my name is sebastian , which i called roderigo .
my name 's sebastian , though i 've been calling myself roderigo .
my father was that sebastian of messaline , whom i know you have heard of .
an hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
a lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
and though i ca n't believe everything people said about her beauty , i 'll be so bold as to say she had a beautiful mind .
she is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
she 's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
if you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
please let me be your servant so i can be with you .
she returns this ring to you , sir .
she 's sending this ring back to you , sir .
you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
you should 've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
none of my lord 's ring ?
orsino never sent her a ring .
how will this fadge ?
i 'm the man she wants .
as i am woman , now , alas the day , what thriftless sighs shall poor olivia breathe !
and since i 'm a woman too bad i 'm a woman olivia 's love for me is hopeless as well !
o time , thou must untangle this , not i .
i ca n't figure it out by myself !

come on , sir andrew .
a false conclusion .
a false conclusion .
am not i consanguineous ?
are n't i her relative , after all ?
or what are you ?
are you all crazy ?
is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
are you trying to turn my mistress 's house into a noisy bar ?
sweet sir toby , be patient for tonight .
dear sir toby , do n't do anything rash tonight .
for monsieur malvolio , let me alone with him .
i 'll make a big fool out of him , just trust me .
i know i can do it .

( viola come here , boy .
how dost thou like this tune ?
what do you think of this song ?
o , fellow , come , the song we had last night .
my friend , sing us the song you sang last night .
it is silly sooth , and dallies with the innocence of love , like the old age .
it tells the simple truth about innocent love , as it was in the good old days .
now , the melancholy god protect thee , and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta , for thy mind is a very opal .
and i hope your tailor will make you an outfit out of fabric that changes color , because your mind is like an opal that changes colors constantly .
once more , cesario , get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
cesario , go visit that cruel olivia one more time .
you tell her so .
but you have to .
make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia .
do n't compare a woman 's love for a man with my love for olivia .

here 's a postscript !
i will do everything that thou wilt have me .
i 'll do everything she wants me to do .
i do live by the church ; for i do live at my house , and my house doth stand by the church .
no , i live by the church because i live in a house , and my house is by the church .
no , indeed , sir ; the lady olivia has no folly .
lady olivia does n't want to have anything to do with foolishness .
it shines everywhere .
i 'm everywhere .
by my troth , i 'll tell thee , i am almost sick for one , ( aside ) though i would not have it grow on my chin .

there 's the way back home for you , due west .
oh , what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of his lip !
i love you so much that i ca n't hide my passion for you , as clever as i am .
a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon than love that would seem hid .
do n't assume that because i 'm pursuing you there 's no reason to pursue me .
it is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
it does n't need to be witty as long as it 's eloquent and imaginative .
i think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
i do n't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .

look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff 's deputy .
his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
the fact that he serves as a go - between for his lord and my niece olivia confirms this .
therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
so this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , is n't going to scare him at all .
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
this will make them both so afraid that they 'll kill each other just by looking at each other .

so draw your sword so he can carry out his vow .
he protests he will not hurt you .
he promises not to hurt you .
viola this comes with seeking you : but there 's no remedy .
but what 'll you do now that i have to ask you for my purse back ?

though the last time i saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
orsino , this is that antonio that took the and her fraught from candy , and this is he that did the board when your young nephew titus lost his leg .
orsino , this is the same antonio who took the and her cargo from crete and captured our ship the during the battle where your young nephew titus lost his leg .
i know not what 't was but distraction .
but then he said strange things to me .
notable pirate !
but you 're a famous pirate !
antonio never yet was thief or pirate , though , i confess , on base and ground enough , orsino 's enemy .
i was never a thief or a pirate , though i admit i was your enemy for good reasons .
a wreck past hope he was .
he was a wreck , almost past hope .
his life i gave him and did thereto add my love , without retention or restraint , all his in dedication .
for his sake i ran the risk of revisiting this unfriendly town , and i drew my sword to defend him when he was in trouble .
you , uncivil lady , to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out that e'er devotion tendered what shall i do ?
i breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered what more am i supposed to do ?
a savage jealousy that sometimes savors nobly .
that kind of savage jealousy sometimes seems noble .
but this your minion , whom i know you love , and whom , by heaven i swear , i tender dearly , him will i tear out of that cruel eye where he sits crowned in his master 's spite .
since you keep denying the love i feel for you , and since i know who 's stealing my place in your heart , you can go on being cold - hearted , but i 'm going to take this boy from you .
come , boy , with me .
come with me , boy .
my thoughts are ripe in mischief : i 'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love to spite a raven 's heart within a dove .
i 'll sacrifice this boy i care for , just to spite a beautiful woman with a heart of stone .
if i do feign , you witnesses above , punish my life for tainting of my love !
the angels in heaven are my witnesses , and can see how pure my love is .
o thou dissembling cub !
goodbye , and take her .
'od 's lifelings , here he is !
you cut my head for no reason .
i never hurt you .
i never hurt you .
of messaline .
i 'm from messaline .
sebastian was my father ; such a sebastian was my brother too , so went he suited to his watery tomb .
sebastian was my father 's name , and my brother was named sebastian too .
if nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurped attire , do not embrace me till each circumstance of place , time , fortune , do cohere and jump that i am viola .
if the only thing keeping us from rejoicing is the fact that i 'm wearing men 's clothes , then do n't hug me till i can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that i 'm viola .
olivia so comes it , lady , you have been mistook .
i 'm still a virgin , so in a sense i 'm a maiden too .
i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
i 've got a letter from you encouraging me to act the way i did .
the madly used malvolio .
signed , the poorly treated malvolio .
madam , i am most apt to embrace your offer .
and now you 'll be your master 's mistress .
pray you , peruse that letter .
please have a look at this letter .
alas , malvolio , this is not my writing , though , i confess , much like the character .
i 'm sorry , malvolio , but this is n't my writing , though i admit it looks like mine .
maria writ the letter at sir toby 's great importance , in recompense whereof he hath married her .
sir toby had maria wrote that letter , and he married her as a reward .
how with a sportful malice it was followed , may rather pluck on laughter than revenge , if that the injuries be justly weighed that have on both sides passed .
we should just laugh about the whole thing rather than get upset about it , especially if we consider that each of the two parties offended the other equally .
why , some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them .
well , you know , some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges .
but do you remember what he said about me before ?
look where they come  .
look at them  .
take but good note  , and you shall see in him the triple pillar of the world transformed into a strumpet 's fool  .
take a good look  , and you 'll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore 's jester  .
behold and see  .
look and see  .
if it be love indeed  , tell me how much  .
if what you feel is really love  , tell me how much  .
there 's beggary in the love that can be reckoned  .
it would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated  .
i 'll set a bourn how far to be beloved  .
i want to measure the extent of your love  , to see how far it stretches  .
then must thou needs find out new heaven  , new earth  .
then you would have to go beyond heaven  , beyond earth  .
news  , my good lord  , from rome  .

why did he marry fulvia if he did n't love her  ?
i 'll seem the fool i am not  .
i 'll pretend to be a fool and believe him  .
antony will be himself  .
he 'll never change  .
but stirred by cleopatra  .
unless he is moved and inspired by cleopatra  .
now  , for the love of love and her soft hours  , let 's not confound the time with conference harsh  .
now  , since we love the feeling of being in love  , let 's not spoil the mood with serious discussion  .
there 's not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure now  .
we should n't spend a minute without some kind of amusement  .
what sport tonight  ?
what shall we do tonight  ?

is caesar with antonius prized so slight  ?
does antony have so little respect for caesar  ?
sir  , sometimes when he is not antony he comes too short of that great property which still should go with antony  .
sir  , sometimes he 's like a different person  , a person who ca n't measure up to the former antony  .

was he not here  ?
was n't he here  ?
no  , madam  .
no  , madam  .
he was disposed to mirth  , but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him  .
he was in a good mood  , and then suddenly he started thinking of rome  .
enobarbus  !
enobarbus  ?
madam  ?
madam  ?
seek him and bring him hither  .
find him and bring him here  .
where 's alexas  ?

fulvia thy wife first came into the field  .
your wife  , fulvia  , mustered her army first  .
against my brother lucius  ?
against my brother lucius  ?
well  , what worst  ?
well  , give me the worst news  .
the nature of bad news infects the teller  .
the bearer of bad news is often blamed for it  .
when it concerns the fool or coward  .
only if the hearer is a fool or a coward  .
on  .
go on  .
things that are past are done  , with me  .
as far as i 'm concerned  , what 's past is done  .
't is thus  : who tells me true  , though in his tale lie death  , i hear him as he flattered  .
it 's like this  : as long as a person tells me the truth  , even though it means my death  , i will listen as though he praised me  .
antony  , thou wouldst say  .
while antony is what you want to say  .
o my lord  !
oh  , my lord  !
fare thee well awhile  .
good - bye for a while  .
at your noble pleasure  .
i 'll be at your service  .
from sicyon  , how  , the news  ?
what 's the news from  .
speak there  .
tell me  .
the man from sicyon
the man from sicyon
is there such an one  ?
is he here  ?
he stays upon your will  .
he 's waiting outside  .
let him appear  .
have him come in  .
these strong egyptian fetters i must break  , or lose myself in dotage  .
i must break cleopatra 's powerful hold over me or else i 'll lose myself in foolish infatuation  .
what are you  ?
what 's your message  ?
fulvia thy wife is dead  .
your wife  , fulvia  , is dead  .
where died she  ?
where did she die  ?
in sicyon  .
in sicyon  .
her length of sickness  , with what else more serious importeth thee to know  , this bears  .
in this letter you 'll find details of her illness and other  , more serious matters that concern you  .
forbear me  .
leave me  .
what 's your pleasure  , sir  ?
what would you like  , sir  ?
i must with haste from hence  .
i have to leave right away  .
why  , then  , we kill all our women  .
that will kill our lovers  .
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them  .
we know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them  .
if they suffer our departure  , death 's the word  .
if we leave  , it will feel like nothing less than death to them  .
i must be gone  .
i must be gone  .
under a compelling occasion  , let women die  .
if it 's that important  , then let the women die  .
it were pity to cast them away for nothing  , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing  .
it would be a pity to throw them away for nothing  , but if it 's a matter of choosing between them and a great cause  , then they 're worthless  .
cleopatra  , catching but the least noise of this  , dies instantly  .
if cleopatra hears even a breath of this  , she 'll die immediately  .
i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment  .
i 've seen her claim to be dying twenty times before  , and for far less reason  .
i do think there is mettle in death  , which commits some loving act upon her  , she hath such a celerity in dying  .
i think there must be something invigorating about death  , since she dies with such enthusiasm  .
she is cunning past man 's thought  .
she 's more cunning than anyone can imagine  .
would i had never seen her  !
i wish i 'd never seen her  !
o sir  , you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel  .
then you 'd have missed an amazing piece of work  , sir  , and your trip would have been poorer for the loss  .
fulvia is dead  .
fulvia is dead  .
sir  ?
pardon me  ?
fulvia is dead  .
fulvia is dead  .
fulvia  ?
fulvia  ?

dead  .
why  , sir  , give the gods a thankful sacrifice  .
then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks  .
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him  , it shows to man the tailors of the earth  , comforting therein  , that when old robes are worn out  , there are members to make new  .
when a man 's wife dies  , he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found  .
if there were no more women but fulvia  , then had you indeed a cut  , and the case to be lamented  .
if fulvia were the last woman on earth  , there would be a reason to grieve  .
this grief is crowned with consolation  .
but in this way  , grief and comfort appear together  .
your old smock brings forth a new petticoat  , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow  .
the only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose  .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence  .
i must go and continue the business fulvia started  .
and the business you have broached here can not be without you  , especially that of cleopatra 's  , which wholly depends on your abode  .
the business you began here needs you as well especially the business with cleopatra  , which only you can attend to  .
i shall do 't  .
i will  .

i did not send you  .
do n't tell him i sent you  .
if you find him sad  , say i am dancing  .
if he 's sad  , tell him i 'm dancing  .
if in mirth  , report that i am sudden sick  .
if he 's happy  , say that i 've suddenly taken sick  .
quick  , and return  .
hurry  , and come back  .
madam  , methinks  , if you did love him dearly  , you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him  .
madam  , i think if you love him so much  , you are n't using the best way to get him to reciprocate  .
what should i do i do not  ?
what should i do that i 'm not doing  ?
in each thing give him way  .
always give him his way  .
cross him in nothing  .
never contradict him  .
tempt him not so too far  .
do n't push him too far  .
i wish  , forbear  .
i wish you 'd be patient  .
in time we hate that which we often fear  .
we come to hate that which controls us  .

i shall fall  .
i shall faint  .
it can not be thus long  .
i wo n't be able to go on this way much longer  .
the sides of nature will not sustain it  .
human nature is n't built to withstand this  .

what 's the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
i know by that same eye there 's some good news  .
i can see in your eyes there 's been some good news  .
what  , says the married woman you may go  ?
what  , does your wife say you can come home  ?
would she had never given you leave to come  !
i wish she 'd never let you come  .
let her not say 't is i that keep you here  .
do n't let her say i kept you  .
i have no power upon you  .
i have no power over you  .
hers you are  .
you belong to her  .
the gods best know
the gods know
oh never was there queen so mightily betrayed  !
oh  , never has a queen been so betrayed as i have been  .
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted  .
i knew from the first it would be this way  .
cleopatra
cleopatra
most sweet queen
most sweet queen
how now  , lady  ?
what do you mean  , lady  ?
i would i had thy inches  .
i wish i were as big and strong as you  .
thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt  .
then you 'd see the courage that lives in the queen of egypt  .
though age from folly could not give me freedom  , it does from childishness  .
i may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth  , but i 'm not that childishly nave  .
can fulvia die  ?
is it possible fulvia is dead  ?
she 's dead  , my queen  .
she 's dead  , my queen  .
you 'll heat my blood  .
you 'll make me angry  .
no more  .
no more of this  .
you can do better yet  , but this is meetly  .
i know you can do better than that  , but it 'll do for now  .
now  , by my sword
i swear by my sword
i 'll leave you  , lady  .
i 'll leave you  , lady  .
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject  , i should take you for idleness itself  .
if you were n't the queen of immaturity  , i 'd think you were immaturity itself  .
here 's more news  .
here 's more news  .
't is pity of him  .
it 's too bad  .
tomorrow  , caesar  , i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time  .
tomorrow  , caesar  , i 'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces i can raise for this war  .
till which encounter it is my business too  .
i 'll be getting my own figures together in the meantime  .

farewell  , my lord  .

you think of him too much  .

madam  , i trust  , not so  .

what 's your highness ' pleasure  ?
what can i do for your highness  ?
not now to hear thee sing  .
i do n't want to hear you sing  .
i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has  .
i 'm not interested in anything a eunuch can do  .
't is well for thee that  , being unseminared  , thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt  .
it 's a good thing for you that  , being castrated  , you can better concentrate on my needs  .
hast thou affections  ?
do you have desires  ?
yes  , gracious madam  .
yes  , dear madam  .
indeed  ?
indeed  ?
not in deed  , madam  , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done  .
well  , not in deed  , madam  , since i ca n't do anything unchaste  .
yet have i fierce affections  , and think what venus did with mars  .
but i do have intense passions and i do think about  .
sovereign of egypt  , hail  !
queen of egypt  , greetings  !
how much unlike art thou mark antony  !
you are nothing like mark antony  !
yet  , coming from him  , that great med'cine hath with his tinct gilded thee  .
but since you come from him  , you 're saturated with his healing spirit  .
how goes it with my brave mark antony  ?
how does it go with my magnificent mark antony  ?
last thing he did  , dear queen  , he kissed the last of many doubled kisses this orient pearl  .

so he nodded  , and soberly did mount an arm - gaunt steed  , who neighed so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbed by him  .
then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse  , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything i might have said in reply  .
what was he  , sad or merry  ?
was he sad or happy  ?
like to the time o ' th ' year between the extremes of hot and cold  , he was nor sad nor merry  .
he was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold  : he was neither sad nor happy  .

pardon me  , but i 'm just repeating what you yourself have said  .

epicurean cooks  , sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite  , that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor even till a lethe 'd dulness
keep his brain drunk and his appetite unsatisfied  , so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and forgetful of his duties  , like the does  .
how now  , varrius  ?
what 's the news  , varrius  ?
this is most certain that i shall deliver  : mark antony is every hour in rome expected  .
this news is absolutely true  : mark antony is expected to arrive in rome at any hour now  .
since he went from egypt 't is a space for farther travel  .
in the time since he left egypt  , he could have traveled an even longer distance  .
i could have given less matter a better ear  .
i would have listened to less important news with greater enthusiasm  .
menas  , i did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm for such a petty war  .
menas  , i had no idea this amorous glutton would have put on his helmet for such an insignificant war  .
his soldiership is twice the other twain  .
his military ability is double that of the other two  .
but let us rear the higher our opinion  , that our stirring can from the lap of egypt 's widow pluck the ne'er lust - wearied antony  .
we must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable antony 's attention away from that egyptian widow  .
good enobarbus  , 't is a worthy deed  , and shall become you well  , to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech  .
good enobarbus  , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly  .
't is not a time for private stomaching  .
this is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances  .
every time serves for the matter that is then born in 't  .
it 's always appropriate to deal with matters as they arise  .
but small to greater matters must give way  .
but major issues must come before minor ones  .
not if the small come first  .
not if the minor ones come up first  .
and yonder  , caesar  .
and there comes caesar  .
if we compose well here  , to parthia  .
if we can come to an agreement here  , we 'll move on to parthia  .
hark  , ventidius  .
listen  , ventidius  .
i do not know  , maecenas  .
i do n't know  , maecenas  .
ask agrippa  .
ask agrippa  .
't is spoken well  .
you 're right  .
were we before our armies  , and to fight  , i should do thus  .
if we were in front of our armies  , about to fight  , i would do this  .
welcome to rome  .
welcome to rome  .
thank you  .
thank you  .
sit  .
have a seat  .
sit  , sir  .
after you  .
nay  , then  .
no  , after you  .
i learn  , you take things ill which are not so  , or being  , concern you not  .
i hear you 've interpreted some of my actions as being improper  , when they were n't improper at all or if they were  , their impropriety did n't concern you  .
i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little  , i should say myself offended  , and with you chiefly i ' th ' world  ; more laughed at  , that i should once name you derogately  , when to sound your name it not concerned me  .
i should be ridiculed if i were offended so easily and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully  , when i had no reason to speak of you at all  .
my being in egypt  , caesar  , what was 't to you  ?
caesar  , what did my stay in egypt have to do with you  ?
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt  .
no more than my staying here in rome might mean to you in egypt  .
yet if you there did practice on my state  , your being in egypt might be my question  .
but if you conspired against my position while you were there  , i might be interested in the reason for your stay in egypt  .
how intend you  , practiced  ?
how do you mean  , conspired  ?
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me  .
you can judge for yourself what i mean  .
your wife and brother made wars upon me  , and their contestation was theme for you  .
your wife and brother led troops against me  , claiming to be fighting in your name  .
you were the word of war  .
they said they were acting for you  .
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me  , but you patched up your excuses  .
you defend yourself by blaming my judgment  , but you 're just making up feeble excuses  .
not so  , not so  .
not true  , not true  .
i know you could not lack  , i am certain on 't  , very necessity of this thought  , that i  , your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought  , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace  .
you know i would never approve a war against my own cause  .
as for my wife  , i would you had her spirit in such another  .
as for my wife  , if only you had such a wife  .
the third o ' th ' world is yours  , which with a snaffle you may pace easy  , but not such a wife  .
it 's easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that  .
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria  .
i sent you a letter while you were carousing in alexandria  .
you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience  .
you put my letters in your pocket without reading them and then mocked my messenger out of the room  .
sir  , he fell upon me ere admitted  , then  .
sir  , he burst into the room without invitation  , just after i had come from an important banquet with three kings  .
three kings i had newly feasted  , and did want of what i was i ' th ' morning  .
i was not myself  , as a result of the wine  .
but next day i told him of myself  , which was as much as to have asked him pardon  .
the next day i explained all this to him  , which was as good as begging his pardon  .
let this fellow be nothing of our strife  .
let 's not fight over this fellow  .
if we contend  , out of our question wipe him  .
if we must argue  , let us remove him from our arguments  .
soft  , caesar  .
easy  , caesar  .
no  , lepidus  , let him speak  .
no  , lepidus  , let him say what 's on his mind  .
the honor is sacred which he talks on now  , supposing that i lacked it  .
now he slanders my honor  , which is sacred to me  .
but  , on  , caesar  .
go on  , caesar  .
the article of my oath  ?
what part of the agreement did i break  ?
't is noble spoken  .
spoken like a gentleman  .
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye  , to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you  .
if it 's okay with you  , you should not press your grievances any further  , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you  .
worthily spoken  , maecenas  .
well put  , maecenas  .
or  , if you borrow one another 's love for the instant  , you may  , when you hear no more words of pompey  , return it again  .
or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with pompey is finished  .
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do  .
you can argue as much as you like when there 's nothing else to do  .
thou art a soldier only  .
you are only a soldier  .
speak no more  .
be quiet  .
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot  .
oh  , i 'd forgotten that no one 's supposed to speak the truth  .
you wrong this presence  .
it 's not appropriate for a soldier to be part of a discussion among noblemen  .
therefore speak no more  .
do n't speak any further  .
go to  , then  .
as you please  .
your considerate stone  .
i 'll pretend to be a conscious stone  , and think without speaking  .
give me leave  , caesar  .
may i speak  , caesar  .
speak  , agrippa  .
what is it  , agrippa  ?
thou hast a sister by the mother 's side  , admired octavia  .
you have a beautiful half - sister  , octavia  .
great mark antony is now a widower  .
great mark antony is a widower now  .
say not so  , agrippa  .
you 'd better not make that suggestion  , agrippa  .
if cleopatra heard you  , your reproof were well deserved of rashness  .
if cleopatra heard you  , you would be well punished for your audacity  .
i am not married  , caesar  .
it 's true i 'm not married  , caesar  .
let me hear agrippa further speak  .
let me hear what agrippa has to say  .
will caesar speak  ?
what do you say  , caesar  ?
not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already  .
i 'd rather hear your reaction to this first  .
the power of caesar  , and his power unto octavia  .
he has both my power and my influence over octavia  .
there 's my hand  .
here 's my hand  .
happily  , amen  !
i 'm happy to say amen to that  !
time calls upon 's  .
there is n't much time  .
of us must pompey presently be sought  , or else he seeks out us  .
either we go after pompey or he 'll come after us  .
where lies he  ?
where is he now  ?
about the mount misena  .
near  .
what is his strength by land  ?
how large is his land army  ?
great and increasing  .
large and increasing  .
but by sea he is an absolute master  .
but his navy rules the sea  .
let us  , lepidus  , not lack your company  .
come with us  , lepidus  .
noble antony  , not sickness should detain me  .
noble antony  , even illness could n't keep me away  .
welcome from egypt  , sir  .
welcome back from egypt  , sir  .
half the heart of caesar  , worthy maecenas  !
you 've become caesar 's right hand man  , maecenas  !
my honorable friend  , agrippa  .
it 's good to see you too  , agrippa  .
good enobarbus  !
good enobarbus  !
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested  .
we can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably  .
you stayed well by 't in egypt  .
and i see you survived your time in egypt  .
eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there  !
we heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast for only twelve people  !
is this true  ?
is that true  ?
this was but as a fly by an eagle  .
that was nothing  .
we had much more monstrous matter of feast  , which worthily deserved noting  .
there were many even more memorable feasts  .
she 's a most triumphant lady  , if report be square to her  .
she 's a remarkable lady  , if the rumors are to be believed  .
when she first met mark antony  , she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus  .
from the first time antony saw her  , sailing on her barge on the  , he was hers  .
there she appeared indeed  , or my reporter devised well for her  .
she made quite an appearance there  , or else my informant invented a very flattering description of her  .
oh  , rare for antony  !
how excellent for antony  !
rare egyptian  !
extraordinary egyptian  !
now antony must leave her utterly  .
now antony has to leave her completely  .
if beauty  , wisdom  , modesty  , can settle the heart of antony  , octavia is a blessd lottery to him  .
if beauty  , wisdom  , and modesty can settle antony 's restless heart  , octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him  .
let us go  .
let 's go  .
good enobarbus  , make yourself my guest whilst you abide here  .
good enobarbus  , consider yourself my guest as long as you 're here  .
humbly  , sir  , i thank you  .
i humbly thank you  .
the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom  .
there will be times when my duties and responsibilities take me away from you  .
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you  .
and i will spend our time apart on my knees  , praying for you  .
good night  , sir  .
good night  , sir  .
my octavia  , read not my blemishes in the world 's report  .
my octavia  , do n't believe everything you hear about me  .
i have not kept my square  , but that to come shall all be done by th ' rule  .
i have n't always lived a conventional life  , but the future will be by the book  .
good night  , dear lady  .
good night  , dear lady  .
good night  , sir  .

would i had never come from thence  , nor you thither  .
i wish i had never left egypt and that you had never come to egypt  .
if you can  , your reason  ?
tell me why  , if you can  .
i see it in my motion  , have it not in my tongue  .

but yet hie you to egypt again  .
but you had better get back to egypt again  .
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher  , caesar 's or mine  ?
tell me who shall have the better luck  , caesar or me  ?
caesar 's  .
caesar  .
therefore  , o antony  , stay not by his side  .
so you 'd better not stay with him  , antony  .
thy dmon that thy spirit which keeps thee is noble  , courageous  , high  , unmatchable where caesar 's is not  .
your guardian angel is noble  , courageous  , significant  , and unmatched when caesar 's not around  .
but near him thy angel becomes afeard  , as being o'erpowered  .
but when you are with him  , your angel is weakened and easily frightened  .
therefore make space enough between you  .
that 's why there must be space between you  .
speak this no more  .
do n't speak of this again  .
get thee gone  .

good - bye then  , until the time i see you dressed in your battle gear  , which will suit you both very well  .
your way is shorter  .
you 're taking a shorter route  .
my purposes do draw me much about  .
my plans take me a roundabout way  .

but  , sirrah  , mark  , we use to say the dead are well  .
but you know  , sirrah  , we customarily say that the dead are well  .
bring it to that  , the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill - uttering throat  .
if that 's what you mean  , i 'll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words  .
good madam  , hear me  .
good madam  , let me speak  .
will 't please you hear me  ?
do you want to hear my news  ?
i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st  .
i have half a mind to hit you before you speak again  .
yet if thou say antony lives  , is well  , or friends with caesar  , or not captive to him  , i 'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail rich pearls upon thee  .
but if antony is alive  , healthy  , friendly with caesar  , and not caesar 's prisoner  , i 'll shower you with gold and pearls  .

make thee a fortune from me  .
i 'm going to make you a rich man  .
but yet  , madam
but yet  , madam
i do not like but yet  .
i do n't like the sound of but yet  .
it does allay the good precedence  .
it reverses all the good that came before it  .
fie upon but yet  .
damn those words  , but yet  !
but yet is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor  .
but yet is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal  .
prithee  , friend  , pour out the pack of matter to mine ear  , the good and bad together  .

it may be honest  , but it 's never wise to bring bad news  .

pompey  , you can not frighten us with your navy  .
we 'll speak with thee at sea  .
we 'll meet you at sea  .
at land  , thou know'st how much we do o'ercount thee  .
you know that on land our army is far greater than yours  .
be pleased to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you  .
to get back to the matter at hand  , what do you think of our proposal  ?
there 's the point  .
that 's the point  .
which do not be entreated to  , but weigh what it is worth embraced  .

you have made me offer of sicily  , sardinia  .
you have offered me the lands of sicily and sardinia  .

if i agree to this  , we may leave unharmed  , with our shields undented  .
that 's our offer  .

i have heard it  , pompey  , and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you  .
i heard what you did for her  , pompey  , and want to give you the many thanks i owe you  .
let me have your hand  .
let me shake your hand  .
i did not think  , sir  , to have met you here  .
i did n't think i would see you here  .
since i saw you last there 's a change upon you  .
you 've changed since the last time i saw you  .
well  , i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face  , but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal  .

a certain queen to caesar in a mattress  .
a certain queen to caesar  ,  .
i know thee now  .
now i know who you are  .
how far'st thou  , soldier  ?
how are you  , soldier  ?
well  , and well am like to do  , for i perceive  , four feasts are toward  .
i 'm well  , and probably will be for a while  , as i hear that four feasts are being prepared  .
let me shake thy hand  .
let me shake your hand  .
i never hated thee  .
i 've never been your enemy  .
i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior  .
i 've seen you fight and envied your skill  .
sir  , i never loved you much  , but i ha ' praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did  .
sir  , i would n't say i was your friend  , but i 've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than i gave  .
show 's the way  , sir  .
show us the way  , sir  .
come  .
come with me  .
thy father  , pompey  , would ne'er have made this treaty  .
your father would never have agreed to this treaty  , pompey  .
you and i have known  , sir  .
you and i have met  , sir  .
at sea  , i think  .
i think it was at sea  .
we have  , sir  .
that it was  , sir  .
you have done well by water  .
you 've done well at sea  .
and you by land  .
and you 've done well on land  .
i will praise any man that will praise me  , though it can not be denied what i have done by land  .
i 'll flatter anyone who flatters me though what i 've accomplished on land can not be denied  .
nor what i have done by water  .
neither can my accomplishments at sea  .
yes  , something you can deny for your own safety  : you have been a great thief by sea  .
yes  , for your own safety  , you should deny one thing  : you have been a great thief at sea  .
and you by land  .
as you were on land  .
there i deny my land service  .
that 's the one part of my service on land i do deny  .
but give me your hand  , menas  .
but let 's shake hands  , menas  .
if our eyes had authority  , here they might take two thieves kissing  .
if our eyes were policemen  , they might capture two thieves at once while we 're embracing  .
all men 's faces are true  , whatsome'er their hands are  .
men 's faces are truthful  , whatever their hands do  .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face  .
but no beautiful woman has an honest face  .
no slander  .
that 's no lie  .
they steal hearts  .
they steal hearts  .
we came hither to fight with you  .
we came here to fight against you  .
for my part  , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking  .
for my part  , i 'm sorry this battle turned into a drinking match  .
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune  .
today pompey laughs away his fortune  .
if he do  , sure he can not weep 't back again  .
if that 's true  , he wo n't get it back by crying  .
you 've said  , sir  .
that 's the truth  , sir  .
we looked not for mark antony here  .
we did n't expect mark antony to be here  .
pray you  , is he married to cleopatra  ?
is he married to cleopatra  ?
caesar 's sister is called octavia  .
caesar 's sister is named octavia  .
true  , sir  .
that 's true  , sir  .
she was the wife of caius marcellus  .
she was previously caius marcellus ' wife  .
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius  .
but she is now mark antony 's wife  .
pray ye  , sir  ?
excuse me  , sir  ?
't is true  .
it 's true  .
then is caesar and he forever knit together  .
then caesar and he will always be united  .
if i were bound to divine of this unity  , i would not prophesy so  .
if i were to make a prediction regarding this union  , i would n't say that  .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties  .
i think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love  .
i think so too  .
i think so too  .
but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity  .
but you 'll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them  .
octavia is of a holy  , cold  , and still conversation  .
octavia has a pious  , chaste  , meek disposition  .
who would not have his wife so  ?
does n't everyone want a wife like that  ?
not he that himself is not so  , which is mark antony  .
not someone who does n't share that disposition  , meaning mark antony  .
he will to his egyptian dish again  .
he 'll go back to his egyptian dish  .
then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar  , and  , as i said before  , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance  .
then octavia 's complaints will rouse caesar  , and as i said before  , the thing that brought them together will part them  .
antony will use his affection where it is  .
antony will go where his passion is  .
he married but his occasion here  .
he only married out of political necessity  .
and thus it may be  .
then that 's the way it may turn out  .
come  , sir  , will you aboard  ?
come on  , sir  , will you come aboard  ?
i have a health for you  .
i want to drink your health  .
i shall take it  , sir  .
i 'll join you  , sir  .
we have used our throats in egypt  .
we did a lot of drinking in egypt  .
come  , let 's away  .
let 's go  .
here they 'll be  , man  .
here 's where they 'll end up  , on the floor  .
some o ' their plants are ill - rooted already  .
some of them are leaning already  .
the least wind i ' th ' world will blow them down  .
it wo n't take much for them to fall over  .
lepidus is high - colored  .
lepidus is red in the face  .
they have made him drink alms - drink  .
they made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor  .
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion  .
which goes on to impede his judgment  .
why  , this it is to have a name in great men 's fellowship  .
that 's what happens when you partner with great men but lack their power  .
i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave  .
i 'd rather carry a reed that obviously ca n't protect me than a sword i can not lift  .
to be called into a huge sphere  , and not to be seen to move in 't  , are the holes where eyes should be  , which pitifully disaster the cheeks  .
to be so unimportant in the company of important men is like having a face without any eyes  .
you 've strange serpents there  ?
do you have unusual snakes there  ?
ay  , lepidus  .
yes  , lepidus  .
they are so  .
yes  , lepidus  .
sit  , and some wine  .
let 's have a seat and some wine  .
a health to lepidus  !
a toast to lepidus  !
i am not so well as i should be  , but i 'll ne'er out  .
i do n't feel so well  , but i wo n't stop  .
not till you have slept  .
not until you pass out  .
i fear me you 'll be in till then  .
i 'm afraid you 'll keep going until then  .
pompey  , a word  .
pompey  , could i have a word with you  ?
say in mine ear  .
whisper it in my ear  .
what is 't  ?
what is it  ?
forsake thy seat  , i do beseech thee  , captain  , and hear me speak a word  .
please  , captain  , leave the feast and let me speak with you privately  .
forbear me till anon  .
leave me alone awhile  .
this wine for lepidus  !
where 's the wine for lepidus  ?
what manner o ' thing is your crocodile  ?
what does a crocodile look like  ?
it is shaped  , sir  , like itself  , and it is as broad as it hath breadth  .
sir  , it 's shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width  .
it is just so high as it is  , and moves with its own organs  .
it is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs  .
it lives by that which nourisheth it  , and  , the elements once out of it  , it transmigrates  .
it lives on what nourishes it  , and when leave it  , its soul moves into another body  .
what color is it of  ?
what color is it  ?
of it own color too  .
its own color  .
't is a strange serpent  .
it 's a strange snake  .
't is so  .
it is that  .
and the tears of it are wet  .
and its tears are wet  .
will this description satisfy him  ?
will that description satisfy him  ?
with the health that pompey gives him  , else he is a very epicure  .
that last toast pompey gave him will take care of him  , unless he 's a raging glutton  .
go hang  , sir  , hang  !
go to hell  , sir  .
tell me of that  ?
are you still here  ?
away  !
go away  !
do as i bid you  .
do what i tell you  .
where 's this cup i called for  ?
where 's the wine i ordered  ?
if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me  , rise from thy stool  .
if any service i 've done you deserves a favor  , get up from your stool and speak with me  .
i think th ' art mad  .
i think you 're crazy  !
the matter  ?
what is it  ?
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes  .
i 've always had great respect for your destiny  .
thou hast served me with much faith  .
you 've served me faithfully  .
what 's else to say  ?
what else can i say  ?
be jolly  , lords  .
be happy  , lords  !
these quicksands  , lepidus  , keep off them  , for you sink  .
stay away from the quicksand of drink  , lepidus  : you 're sinking  .
wilt thou be lord of all the world  ?
would you like to be king of the entire world  ?
what sayst thou  ?
what are you saying  ?
wilt thou be lord of the whole world  ?
would you like to be king of the entire world  ?
that 's twice  .
now i 've said it twice  .
how should that be  ?
how could that happen  ?
hast thou drunk well  ?
are you drunk  ?
no  , pompey  , i have kept me from the cup  .
no  , pompey  , i have n't had anything to drink  .
thou art  , if thou dar'st be  , the earthly jove  .
you can be the most powerful man on earth if you dare use your power  .
whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine  , if thou wilt ha 't  .
both land and sea are yours if you will take them  .
show me which way  .
tell me how  .
for this  , i 'll never follow thy palled fortunes more  .
for this  , i 'll never be faithful to your declining fortunes again  .
who seeks and will not take when once 't is offered shall never find it more  .
a person who wants something but wo n't take it when it materializes wo n't get the opportunity again  .
this health to lepidus  !
this toast is for lepidus  !
here 's to thee  , menas  !
here 's to you  , menas  .
enobarbus  , welcome  .
i accept with thanks  , enobarbus  .
fill till the cup be hid  .
fill the cups until they run over  .
there 's a strong fellow  , menas  .
there goes a strong fellow  , menas  .
why  ?
why do you say that  ?
he bears the third part of the world  , man  .
he carries a third of the world  .
seest not  ?
ca n't you see that  ?
drink thou  .
drink up  .
increase the reels  .
liven up the party  .
come  .
all right  , then  .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast  .
this has n't reached the level of an egyptian feast yet  .
it ripens towards it  .
it 's getting there  .
strike the vessels  , ho  !
clink your cups together in a toast  !
here 's to caesar  .
here 's to caesar  .
be a child o ' th ' time  .
live in the moment  .
possess it  , i 'll make answer  .
i 'd prefer to seize the day  .
but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one  .
but i would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one  .
ha  !
ha  !
my brave emperor  , shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals and celebrate our drink  ?
shall we dance egyptian  , my noble emperor  , and celebrate our wine  ?
let 's ha 't  , good soldier  .
let 's have one  , good soldier  .
come  , let 's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe  .
come  , let 's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful  .
all take hands  .
everyone join hands  .
make battery to our ears with the loud music  , the while i 'll place you  ; then the boy shall sing  .
attack our ears with loud music  , and i 'll position you for the dance  .
the holding every man shall beat as loud as his strong sides can volley  .
then the boy will sing  , and every man will sing the chorus at the top of his voice  .
what would you more  ?
how can you top that  ?
pompey  , good night  .
good night  , pompey  .
good brother  , let me request you off  .
dear brother - in - law  , let 's leave together  .
our graver business frowns at this levity  .
this frivolity is n't appropriate to the serious purpose that brought us here  .
gentle lords  , let 's part  .
noble lords  , let 's say good night  .
you see we have burnt our cheeks  .
we 've all gotten red in the face  .
strong enobarb is weaker than the wine  ; and mine own tongue splits what it speaks  .
even the strong enobarbus is n't immune to the effects of wine  , and i 'm tongue - tied myself  .
the wild disguise hath almost anticked us all  .
this wild party has almost turned us all into clowns  .
what needs more words  ?
what more need i say  ?
good night  .
good night  .
good antony  , your hand  .
good antony  , shake my hand  .
i 'll try you on the shore  .

take heed you fall not  .
be careful not to fall in  .
menas  , i 'll not on shore  .
menas  , i 'm not going back on shore  .
hoo  !
hooray  !
noble captain  , come  .
come on  , noble captain  .
thou hast  , ventidius  , that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction  .
a soldier is just a tool  , like his sword  , unless he has your qualities  , ventidius  .
thou wilt write to antony  ?
are you going to write antony about this  ?
where is he now  ?
where 's antony now  ?
he purposeth to athens  , whither  , with what haste the weight we must convey with 's will permit  , we shall appear before him  .
he plans to go to athens  .
on  , there  .
we must arrive there before him  , as quickly as our baggage train will allow us  .
pass along  !
get a move on  !
what  , are the brothers parted  ?
did the brothers - in - law leave  ?
a very fine one  .
he 's a stylish man  .
oh  , how he loves caesar  !
and how he loves caesar  !
nay  , but how dearly he adores mark antony  !
yes  , but how he adores mark antony  !
what 's antony  ?
then what 's antony  ?
the god of jupiter  .
a god of a god  ?
spake you of caesar  ?
are you talking about caesar  ?
how  , the nonpareil  !
he 's without equal  !
indeed  , he plied them both with excellent praises  .
he certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments  .
but he loves caesar best  ; yet he loves antony  .
he loves caesar best  , but he also loves antony  .
hoo  !
oh  !
hearts  , tongues  , figures  , scribes  , bards  , poets  , can not think  , speak  , cast  , write  , sing  , number hoo  !
no one can describe or fathom lepidus ' love for antony  !
his love to antony  .
hearts can not think it  , tongues can not speak it  , meas - urements can not calculate it  , scribes can not write it  , bards can not sing it  , and poets can not make verses about it  .
but as for caesar  , kneel down  , kneel down  , and wonder  .
but when it comes to caesar  , lepidus ' love approaches the awestruck wonder of a worshipper  .
both he loves  .
he loves them both  .
they are his shards  , and he  .
they are his dung  , and he their beetle  .
so  , this is to horse  .
so  , there 's the signal to ride  .
adieu  , noble agrippa  .
good - bye  , noble agrippa  .
good fortune  , worthy soldier  , and farewell  .
good luck  , worthy soldier  , and good - bye  .
no further  , sir  .
you ca n't go any further with us  , sir  .
you take from me a great part of myself  ; use me well in 't  .
you take an important part of myself with you  .
sister  , prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee  , and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof  .
treat it well  .
most noble antony  , let not the piece of virtue  , which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love  , to keep it builded  , be the ram to batter the fortress of it  .
sister  , be the kind of wife i hope you will be  , and that this great contract rests upon your being gracious antony  , do n't let my sister  , this epitome of virtue that connects us  , become the reason we separate  .
for better might we have loved without this mean  , if on both parts this be not cherished  .
if you and i do n't value her equally  , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her  .
make me not offended in your distrust  .
do n't insult me with your distrust  .
i have said  .
i mean what i say  .
you shall not find  , though you be therein curious  , the least cause for what you seem to fear  .
you wo n't find any cause for anxiety  , even if you look for one  .
so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends  .
so  , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the romans so that they turn and give you their support  .
we will here part  .
we 'll leave you here  .
farewell  , my dearest sister  , fare thee well  .
good - bye  , my dearest sister  , good - bye  .
the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort  !
i hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease  .
fare thee well  .
farewell  .
my noble brother  !

i 'll tell you in your ear  .
i 'll tell you privately  .
will caesar weep  ?
do you think caesar will cry  ?
he has a cloud in 's face  .
he does look like it  .
thus i let you go and give you to the gods  .
and thus i let you go and give you to the gods  .
adieu  .
good - bye  .
be happy  .
be happy  .
let all the number of the stars give light to thy fair way  .
may every star light your path  .

come here  , sir  .
good majesty  , herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased  .
gracious queen  , even herod of judea would n't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood  .
most gracious majesty  !

didst hear her speak  ?
did you hear her speak  ?
is she shrill - tongued or low  ?
is her voice pitched high or low  ?
madam  , i heard her speak  .
madam  , i heard her speak  .
she is low - voiced  .
she has a low - pitched voice  .
that 's not so good  .
that 's not in her favor  .
he can not like her long  .
he ca n't like her very long  .
like her  ?
like her  ?
o isis  , 't is impossible  .
oh  , isis  , that 's impossible  .
i think so  , charmian  .
you 're right  , charmian  .
dull of tongue  , and dwarfish  .
she 's both dull - spoken and dwarfishly little  .
what majesty is in her gait  ?
did she carry herself with majesty  ?
remember  , if e'er thou looked'st on majesty  .
compare her to any memory you might have of royalty  .
is this certain  ?
is this true  ?
or i have no observance  .
if not  , then i have no powers of observation  .
three in egypt can not make better note  .
there are n't three people in all of egypt who could do better  .

usually that means a person is foolish  .
her hair  , what color  ?
what color is her hair  ?
brown  , madam  , and her forehead as low as she would wish it  .
brown  , madam  , and she would n't want her forehead to be any lower  .
a proper man  .
he 's an admirable man  .
indeed  , he is so  .
he certainly is  .
i repent me much that so i harried him  .
i 'm very sorry i was so hard on him  .
why  , methinks  , by him  , this creature 's no such thing  .
why  , from what he says  , octavia is n't worth getting upset over  .
nothing  , madam  .
not a bit  , madam  .
hath he seen majesty  ?
been around royalty  !
isis else defend  , and serving you so long  !

thanks to my lord  .
thank you  , my lord  .
the jove of power make me most weak  , most weak  , your reconciler  !
may the god of power make me  , the weakest of the weak  , your mediator  .
wars 'twixt you twain would be as if the world should cleave  , and that slain men should solder up the rift  .
a war between you two would split the very world  , and the bodies of your slaughtered soldiers would have to fill the chasm between  .

my news i might have told hereafter  .
i should have waited to tell you my news  .
come  , sir  .
come with me  , sir  .
contemning rome  , he has done all this and more in alexandria  .
in alexandria he condemned rome  , and that 's not all  .
here 's the manner of 't  : i ' th ' marketplace  , on a tribunal silvered  , cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned  .
this is what happened  : he and cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver - covered stage in the marketplace  .
at the feet sat caesarion  , whom they call my father 's son  , and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them  .
and all their illegitimate children sat at their feet  .
unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt  , made her of lower syria  , cyprus  , lydia  , absolute queen  .
antony confirmed her possession of egypt and made her absolute queen of lower syria  , cyprus  , and lydia  .
this in the public eye  ?
he did this in public  ?
let rome be thus informed  .
let 's send this news to rome  .
the people knows it  , and have now received his accusations  .
the people have heard it already  , and they 've been told of his accusations  .
who does he accuse  ?
who does he accuse  ?
caesar  , and that  , having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled  , we had not rated him his part o ' th ' isle  .
he accuses me of withholding his share of sextus pompeius ' possessions  , which we seized in sicily  .
then does he say he lent me some shipping  , unrestored  .
then he says i did n't return some ships he loaned me  .
lastly  , he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed  , and  , being  , that we detain all his revenue  .
finally  , he criticizes the deposing of lepidus  , and then goes on to accuse me of keeping all of lepidus ' property for myself  .
sir  , this should be answered  .
sir  , these accusations should be answered  .
he 'll never yield to that  .
he 'll never agree to that  .
nor must not then be yielded to in this  .
then we wo n't agree to his demands  .
hail  , caesar  , and my lord  !
greetings  , caesar  , my lord  !
hail  , most dear caesar  !
greetings  , dearest caesar  !
that ever i should call thee castaway  !
oh  , to think you 've been rejected  !
you have not called me so  , nor have you cause  .
you 've never thought of me like that  , and you have no reason to  .
which soon he granted  , being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him  .
which he quickly allowed  , given that you 're an obstacle to his lust  .
do not say so  , my lord  .
do n't say that  , my lord  .
i have eyes upon him  , and his affairs come to me on the wind  .
i 've kept track of him  , and reports of his affairs arrive on every ship  .
where is he now  ?
where do you think he is now  ?
my lord  , in athens  .
he 's in athens  , my lord  .
welcome  , lady  .

each heart in rome does love and pity you  .
every heart in rome loves and pities you  .
only th ' adulterous antony  , most large in his abominations  , turns you off and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us  .
only the adulterous and abominable antony abandons you  , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us  .
is it so  , sir  ?
is that true  , sir  ?
most certain  .
it 's undeniable  .
sister  , welcome  .
you are welcome here  , sister  .
pray you be ever known to patience  .
i beg you to continue to be patient  .
my dear'st sister  !
my dearest sister  !
but why  , why  , why  ?
but why  , why  , why  ?
is 't not denounced against us  ?
is n't this war against me  ?
why should not we be there in person  ?
why should n't i be there in person  ?
well  , i could reply  , if we should serve with horse and mares together  , the horse were merely lost  .
well  , i could answer that if we went to war on male and female horses alike the male horses would be totally distracted and useless  .
the mares would bear a soldier and his horse  .
the mares would be ridden by their riders and the male horses  .
what is 't you say  ?
what do you mean  ?
sink rome  !
let rome fall  !
and their tongues rot that speak against us  !
may the tongues of our critics rot  !
a charge we bear i ' th ' war  , and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man  .
i have responsibilities in this war  , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom i will carry out my duties as if i were a man  .
speak not against it  .
do n't argue against it  .
i will not stay behind  .
i wo n't stay behind  .
nay  , i have done  .
no  , i 've had my say  .
here comes the emperor  .
here comes the emperor  .
is it not strange  , canidius  , that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne  ?
is n't it strange  , canidius  , that he could cross the ionian sea so quickly from tarentum and brundusium and take toryne  ?
you have heard on 't  , sweet  ?
have you heard about this  , sweet  ?
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent  .
no one admires speed more than the lazy  .
a good rebuke  , which might have well becomed the best of men  , to taunt at slackness  .
that 's a good reprimand  , suitable for reminding even the best of men to guard against negligence  .
canidius  , we will fight with him by sea  .
canidius  , we 'll fight him at sea  .
why will my lord do so  ?
why do you want to do that  , my lord  ?
for that he dares us to 't  .
because he 's daring us to do it  .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight  .
so you 've dared him to single combat  .
ay  , and to wage this battle at pharsalia  , where caesar fought with pompey  .
yes  , and you dared caesar to fight the battle at pharsalia  , where he fought against pompey  .
but these offers  , which serve not for his vantage  , he shakes off  , and so should you  .
but caesar ignores offers that do n't give him an advantage  , and so should you  .

we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot  .
we are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe  .
well  , well  , away  .
well  , well  , let 's go  .
by hercules  , i think i am i ' th ' right  .
by hercules  , i think i 'm right  .
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole  , do you not  ?
on land you keep the legions and cavalry together  , do n't you  ?
marcus octavius  , marcus justeius  , publicola  , and caelius  , are for sea  ; but we keep whole by land  .
marcus octavius  , marcus justeius  , publicola  , and caelius will go by sea  , but we 'll keep the bulk on land  .
this speed of caesar 's carries beyond belief  .
caesar 's speed defies belief  .
while he was yet in rome his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies  .
while he was still in rome  , he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled  .
who 's his lieutenant  , hear you  ?
who 's his lieutenant  , do you know  ?
they say  , one taurus  .
a man named taurus  , they say  .
well i know the man  .
i know the man well  .

our fortune lies upon this jump  .
our fate depends on this chance  .
naught  , naught  , all naught  !
we 're ruined  , ruined  , ruined  !
i can behold no longer  .
i ca n't watch any more  .
th '  , the egyptian admiral  , with all their sixty  , fly and turn the rudder  .
the egyptian flagship  , the followed by all sixty egyptian ships  , has turned and fled  .
to see 't mine eyes are blasted  .
it destroyed my eyes to look upon it  .
gods and goddesses  , all the whole synod of them  !
gods and goddesses the whole congregation of them  !
what 's thy passion  ?
what 's wrong with you  ?
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance  .
we have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness  .
we have kissed away kingdoms and provinces  .
we have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces  .
how appears the fight  ?
how goes the battle  ?
on our side like the tokened pestilence  , where death is sure  .
our side shows all the signs of certain defeat  , which appear like the symptomatic sores of the plague  .
yon ribaudred nag of egypt whom leprosy o'ertake  !
right in the middle of the fight  , just when the battle could have gone either way actually we had a slight advantage that immoral egyptian nag may she die of leprosy  !
i ' th ' midst o ' th ' fight  , when vantage like a pair of twins appeared both as the same  , or rather ours the elder  , the breeze upon her  , like a cow in june  , hoists sails and flies  .
suddenly became frightened  , and turned her ships around and fled  .
that i beheld  .
i saw that  .
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view  .
the sight made me so sick i could n't watch any more  .
our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably  .
the battle on the sea is almost lost  .
had our general been what he knew himself  , it had gone well  .
if our general had been his old self  , we would have won  .
oh  , he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own  !
oh  , with his sordid desertion  , he sets the example for our own  .
ay  , are you thereabouts  ?
are you considering desertion  , as well  ?
why then  , good night indeed  .
then everything must really be finished  .
toward peloponnesus are they fled  .
they fled toward peloponnesus  .
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse  .
i 'll yield my legions and cavalry to caesar  .
six kings already show me the way of yielding  .
in this  , i follow the examples of the six kings who have already surrendered  .
i 'll yet follow the wounded chance of antony  , though my reason sits in the wind against me  .
i 'll still follow antony  , even though the odds are against him and good sense tells me i should go the other way  .
hark  .
listen  .
the land bids me tread no more upon 't  .
the earth tells me to stop walking upon it  , as it 's ashamed to carry me  .
it is ashamed to bear me  .
friends  , come here  .
friends  , come hither  .
i 'm completely lost  .
i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever  .
i have a ship full of treasure  .
i have a ship laden with gold  .

madam  , oh  , good empress  !
sir  , sir

ah  , stand by  .
ah  , give us some privacy  .
the queen  , my lord  , the queen  .
the queen is here  , my lord  .
go to him  , madam  , speak to him  .
go to him  , madam  , speak to him  .
he is unqualitied with very shame  .
he 's not himself because he feels so ashamed  .
most noble sir  , arise  .
most noble sir  , stand up  .
the queen approaches  .
the queen is coming  .
her head 's declined  , and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue  .

o my lord  , my lord  , forgive my fearful sails  !
oh  , my lord  , my lord  , forgive my panic  !
i little thought you would have followed  .
i did n't think you would follow me  .
egypt  , thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th ' strings  , and thou shouldst tow me after  .
queen  , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you  .
o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st  , and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me  .
you knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that i would ignore the gods ' orders in favor of yours  .
oh  , my pardon  !
oh  , forgive me  !
fall not a tear  , i say  .
do n't shed even one tear  .
one of them rates all that is won and lost  .
one of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost  .
give me a kiss  .
give me a kiss  .
even this repays me  .
this repays me  .
we sent our schoolmaster  .
i sent our children 's schoolmaster to caesar with our offer  .
is he come back  ?
has he returned  ?
love  , i am full of lead  .
love  , i am full of heaviness  .
some wine  , within there  , and our viands  !
servants  , bring some wine and food  !
fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows  .
we have the most contempt for fortune when it goes against us  .
let him appear that 's come from antony  .
let the envoy from antony come in  .
know you him  ?
do you know him  ?
approach and speak  .
come forward and speak  .
such as i am  , i come from antony  .
humble as i am  , i represent antony  .
i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morn - dew on the myrtle leaf to his grand sea  .
until recently  , i was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean  .
be 't so  .
so be it  .
declare thine office  .
say what you 're here for  .
for antony  , i have no ears to his request  .
as for antony  , i 'm not interested in his requests  .
the queen of audience nor desire shall fail  , so she from egypt drive her all - disgracd friend or take his life there  .
i 'll give the queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of egypt or kills him  .
this if she perform  , she shall not sue unheard  .
then i 'll listen to her  .
so to them both  .
give my answer to them both  .
fortune pursue thee  !
may good luck follow you  !
bring him through the bands  .
take him safely through the lines  .
caesar  , i go  .
i go  , caesar  .
observe how antony becomes his flaw  , and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves  .
observe how antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions  .
caesar  , i shall  .
i will  , caesar  .
what shall we do  , enobarbus  ?
what are we going to do  , enobarbus  ?
think and die  .
think about our situation  , then die  .
is antony or we in fault for this  ?
who is to blame for this  : antony or i  ?
prithee  , peace  .
please  , let 's not talk about it  .
is that his answer  ?
is that his answer  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
the queen shall then have courtesy  , so she will yield us up  ?
the queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up  ?
he says so  .
that 's what he says  .
let her know 't  .
tell her  .
to the boy caesar send this grizzled head  , and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities  .
if you send my aged head to that boy  , caesar  , he 'll give you all the kingdoms you want  .
that head  , my lord  ?
your head  , my lord  ?
to him again  .
go back to him  .
tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him  , from which the world should note something particular  .
tell him that his cheeks still bear the pink flush of youth  , and that the world expects to see something remarkable from him  .
his coin  , ships  , legions  , may be a coward 's  , whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i ' th ' command of caesar  .
his treasure  , his navy  , and his armies might belong to a coward  , and his ministers might be able to succeed just as well on behalf of a child as under the command of caesar  .
i dare him therefore to lay his gay caparisons apart and answer me declined  , sword against sword  , ourselves alone  .
therefore  , i dare him to lay aside his fancy trappings and meet this old man in single combat  , sword against sword  , just the two of us  .
i 'll write it  .
i 'll write the challenge  .
follow me  .
follow me  .
a messenger from caesar  .
a messenger has arrived from caesar  .
mine honesty and i begin to square  .
my integrity and i begin to contradict each other  .
the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly  .
being loyal to a fool makes loyalty foolish  .
yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i ' th ' story  .
but a person who can bear to keep his allegiance to a defeated lord defeats his lord 's conqueror and earns a place in history  .
caesar 's will  ?
what does caesar want  ?
hear it apart  .
it is for your ears only  .
none but friends  .
there are only friends here  .
say boldly  .
speak confidently  .
so haply are they friends to antony  .
so they are possibly antony 's friends  .
go on  .
respectfully put  .
right royal  .
go on  .
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love  , but as you feared him  .
he knows that you did n't embrace antony because you loved him  , but because you feared him  .
oh  !
oh  !
the scars upon your honor therefore he does pity as constraind blemishes  , not as deserved  .
so he regrets that any dishonorable acts were forced on you  , not being performed of your own free will  .
he is a god and knows what is most right  .
he is like a god and knows the truth  .
mine honor was not yielded  , but conquered merely  .
my honor was n't given  ; it was only dominated  .
shall i say to caesar what you require of him  ?
shall i tell caesar what you request from him  ?
for he partly begs to be desired to give  .
he almost begs for the opportunity to help you  .
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon  .
it would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you  .
but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left antony and put yourself under his shroud  , the universal landlord  .
but he would feel even better if i could tell him that you had left antony and put yourself under his protection  .
what 's your name  ?
what 's your name  ?
my name is thidias  .
my name is thidias  .
most kind messenger  , say to great caesar this in deputation  : i kiss his conqu'ring hand  .
most kind messenger  , tell great caesar that through his deputy i kiss his conquering hand  .
tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at 's feet  , and there to kneel  .
tell him i am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him  .
tell him  , from his all - obeying breath i hear the doom of egypt  .
tell him whose decrees are obeyed by the whole world that i will accept the fate he chooses for egypt  .
't is your noblest course  .
that 's your most dignified course of action  .
wisdom and fortune combating together  , if that the former dare but what it can  , no chance may shake it  .
when confronted with the choice between a prudent action and a risky one  , a wise man should dare to do only what he can practically accomplish if he follows this course  , he will never be subjected to unpredictable chance  .
give me grace to lay my duty on your hand  .
allow me to pay my respects by kissing your hand  .
your caesar 's father oft  , when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in  , bestowed his lips on that unworthy place as it rained kisses  .
when octavius caesar 's father thought about conquering kingdoms  , he rained kisses on my unworthy hand  .

promising favors  ?

what art thou  , fellow  ?
who are you  , slave  ?
one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man  , and worthiest to have command obeyed  .
a person who merely follows the orders of the best man  , the man most worthy of service  .
you will be whipped  .
you will be whipped  .
take hence this jack and whip him  .
take away this lout and whip him  .
't is better playing with a lion 's whelp than with an old one dying  .

you were half blasted ere i knew you  .
you were damaged goods before i met you  .
ha  !

have i my pillow left unpressed in rome  , forborne the getting of a lawful race  , and by a gem of women  , to be abused by one that looks on feeders  ?
did i desert my bed in rome  , passing up the chance to have a legitimate family with a jewel of a woman  , in order to be deceived by one who wastes her favors on servants  ?
good my lord
my good lord
you have been a boggler ever  .
you 've always been a liar  .
but when we in our viciousness grow hard oh  , misery on 't  !
but when our vices become habits oh  , the sadness of it  !
the wise gods seel our eyes  , in our own filth drop our clear judgments  , make us adore our errors  , laugh at 's while we strut to our confusion  .
the wise gods blind us  , shade our better judgment  , make us love our mistakes  , and laugh as we strut to our ruin  .
oh  , is 't come to this  ?
oh  , has it come to this  ?
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar 's trencher  .
you were a cold crumb on dead julius caesar 's plate when i met you  .
nay  , you were a fragment of gneius pompey 's  , besides what hotter hours  , unregistered in vulgar fame  , you have luxuriously picked out  .
no  , you were one of gneius pompey 's leftovers not to mention your other  , more depraved affairs  , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip  .
for i am sure  , though you can guess what temperance should be  , you know not what it is  .
for i 'm sure that although you may know what temperance is  , you 've never experienced it firsthand  .
wherefore is this  ?
why are you doing this  ?
is he whipped  ?
has he been whipped  ?
soundly  , my lord  .
soundly  , my lord  .
cried he  ?
did he cry  ?
and begged he pardon  ?
did he beg my pardon  ?
he did ask favor  .
he did ask for mercy  .
have you done yet  ?
are you done yet  ?
alack  , our terrene moon is now eclipsed  , and it portends alone the fall of antony  .
you  , my earthly moon  , are now eclipsed  , and that alone foretells my ruin  .
i must stay his time  .
i must wait for him to finish his tirade  .
to flatter caesar  , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points  ?
in order to flatter caesar  , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants  ?
not know me yet  ?
do n't you know me still  ?
coldhearted toward me  ?
has your heart cooled toward me  ?
ah  , dear  , if i be so  , from my cold heart let heaven engender hail  , and poison it in the source  , and the first stone drop in my neck  .
ah  , dear  , if that is true  , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart  , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat  .
as it determines  , so dissolve my life  !
as it dissolves  , so shall my life  .
the next caesarion smite  , till by degrees the memory of my womb  , together with my brave egyptians all  , by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey  !
the next hailstone should hit caesarion  , until one by one all my children  , and every one of my brave egyptians  , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied  , covered by gnats and flies  .
that 's my brave lord  !
that 's my brave lord  !
it is my birthday  .
it 's my birthday  .
i had thought t ' have held it poor  ; but since my lord is antony again  , i will be cleopatra  .
i had planned to celebrate it quietly  , but since my lord is once more himself  , i will be cleopatra again  .
we will yet do well  .
we 'll win yet  .
call all his noble captains to my lord  .
call all my lord 's noble captains to him  .
let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight  .
tell our top commanders that i want tomorrow 's battle to be the last we fight  .
within our files there are  , of those that served mark antony but late  , enough to fetch him in  .
our army has recently acquired many of mark antony 's former soldiers enough to capture him  .
see it done and feast the army  .
see that it is done  , and prepare a feast for the soldiers  .
we have store to do 't  , and they have earned the waste  .
we have enough supplies for it  , and they 've earned it  .
poor antony  !
poor antony  !
he will not fight with me  , domitius  ?
he wo n't fight with me  , domitius  ?
no  .
no  .
why should he not  ?
why wo n't he  ?
he thinks  , being twenty times of better fortune  , he is twenty men to one  .
he thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours  , it would be like pitting twenty men against one  .
tomorrow  , soldier  , by sea and land i 'll fight  .
tomorrow  , soldier  , i 'll fight by sea and land  .
or i will live or bathe my dying honor in the blood shall make it live again  .
by the end i will either live  , or else i 'll restore my honor by shedding my blood  .
woo't thou fight well  ?
will you fight well  ?

what means this  ?

't is one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots out of the mind  .
it 's one of those nostalgic moods caused by sorrow  .
and thou art honest too  .
and you 're honest too  .
i wish i could be made so many men  , and all of you clapped up together in an antony  , that i might do you service so good as you have done  .
i wish i could split into as many men as there are servants here before me  , and that all of you could merge into a single antony  , so i could give you the same good service you 've given me  .
the gods forbid  !

he wants to make his followers weep  .
tend me tonight  .

may be it is the period of your duty  .
it 's possible that this will be the end of your service  .

rarely  , rarely  .
excellently  , excellently  .
he that unbuckles this  , till we do please to doff 't for our repose  , shall hear a storm  .
anyone who unbuckles this before i want to take it off to rest will be sorry  .

you 're fumbling  , eros  .

my queen 's a better squire than you are  .
o love  , that thou couldst see my wars today  , and knew'st the royal occupation  !

to business that we love we rise betimes and go to 't with delight  .
when we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully  .
a thousand  , sir  , early though 't be  , have on their riveted trim and at the port expect you  .

oh  , he 's more mad than telamon for his shield  .
oh  , antony is more furious than telamon  , who killed himself in a jealous rage  .
the boar of thessaly was never so embossed  .
the wild boar of thessaly  , which the goddess diana sent to punish king caledon for neglecting her sacrifices  , did n't foam at the mouth as much as antony does now  .

there lock yourself and send him word you are dead  .
lock yourself in and send him word that you 're dead  .

that 's true  , my lord  .
oh  , thy vile lady  !

i would not see 't  .
i would not  .

draw and come  .
take out your sword and come on  .
turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies  .
then turn your noble face away from me  , that face that the whole world adores  .
lo thee  !

the star is fall'n  .
our guiding light is out  .
and time is at his period  .
and time itself is ended  .
alas  , and woe  !
sadness and despair  !
let him that loves me strike me dead  .

give me some wine and let me speak a little  .
give me some wine and let me say a few words  .
no  , let me speak  , and let me rail so high that the false huswife fortune break her wheel  , provoked by my offense  .
no  , let me talk  , and let me scold to the heavens  , so that
they do not go together  .
honor and safety do not go together  .
my resolution and my hands i 'll trust  , none about caesar  .
i 'll trust my determination and my hands  , but none of caesar 's men  .
oh  , withered is the garland of the war  .
oh  , the glory of war has faded  .
the soldier 's pole is fall'n  !
the flags have fallen  .
young boys and girls are level now with men  .
young boys and girls are equal to men  .
the odds is gone  , and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon  .
there is nothing distinctive  , nothing remarkable left in the world  .

i am called dercetus  .
my name is decretus  .
mark antony i served  , who best was worthy best to be served  .
i served mark antony  , who was the commander most worthy of my services  .
whilst he stood up and spoke  , he was my master  , and i wore my life to spend upon his haters  .
while he was alive  , i lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies  .
if thou please to take me to thee  , as i was to him i 'll be to caesar  .
if you accept my service  , i 'll serve you the same way  .

if not  , you can kill me  .
what is 't thou say'st  ?
what are you saying  ?
i say  , o caesar  , antony is dead  .
caesar  , i 'm telling you that antony is dead  .
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack  .
when such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap  .
the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens  .
the fractured world  , in its confusion  , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions ' dens  .
the death of antony is not a single doom  .
this is n't the death of one man  .
in the name lay a moiety of the world  .
it 's the death of half the world  .
look you  , sad friends  , the gods rebuke me  , but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings  .
listen  , sad friends  , though the gods may rebuke me  , this news would make kings cry  .
and strange it is that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds  .
it 's strange that human nature makes us grieve for the very thing we 've been trying to achieve  .
his taints and honors waged equal with him  .
his faults were equally matched by his virtues  .
when such a spacious mirror 's set before him  , he needs must see himself  .
it 's impossible for him not to see himself in antony  .
but i will tell you at some meeter season  .
i 'll tell you at a better time  .
the business of this man looks out of him  .
this man looks like his business is urgent  .
we 'll hear him what he says  .
let 's hear what he has to say  .
whence are you  ?
who are you  ?
so the gods preserve thee  !

i 'm sure you 've heard of me  .
no matter  , sir  , what i have heard or known  .
it does n't matter what i 've heard or known  .
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams  .
you must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams  .

is n't that your habit  ?
i understand not  , madam  .
i do n't know what you mean  , madam  .
i dreamt there was an emperor antony  .
i dreamed about an emperor called antony  .
oh  , such another sleep  , that i might see but such another man  !

his face was as the heavens  , and therein stuck a sun and moon  , which kept their course and lighted the little o  , the earth  .
authority radiated from his face  , and his presence brought knowledge and order to the people of earth  .
most sovereign creature
your majesty
his legs bestrid the ocean  .
his power extended from one shore to the other  , as if he straddled the ocean with his legs  .
his reared arm crested the world  .
when he raised his arm in command  , the world trembled  .
his voice was propertied as all the tund spheres  , and that to friends  .
he spoke exquisitely to his friends  , but when he wanted to terrify the world  , his voice was like thunder  .
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb  , he was as rattling thunder  .
there was no end to his generosity  .
for his bounty  , there was no winter in 't  , an autumn 't was that grew the more by reaping  .
the more he gave  , the more he wanted to give  .
his delights were dolphinlike  ; they showed his back above the element they lived in  .
his amusements showed another side of him  , one detached from his world of responsibility and duty  .
in his livery walked crowns and crownets  .
kings and noblemen served him  .
realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket  .
kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change  .

what  , you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke  ?
so  , are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow  ?
marry  , do i  , sir  , and i came to acquaint you with a matter  .
indeed i do  , sir  , and i 've come to let you in on a certain problem  .
i am given  , sir  , secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall  .
i 've been informed by certain sources i ca n't disclose that your younger brother orlando plans to fight me in disguise  .
tomorrow  , sir  , i wrestle for my credit  , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well  .
tomorrow  , sir  , i 'm fighting for my reputation  , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed  .
your brother is but young and tender  , and  , for your love i would be loath to foil him  , as i must for my own honor if he come in  .
your brother is young and inexperienced  , and because of my affection for you  , i 'd hate to crush him though i 'd have to  , if he challenged me  .
therefore  , out of my love to you  , i came hither to acquaint you withal  , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into  , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will  .
i 'm telling you all this out of affection for you  , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace  , which will be his own fault  , not mine  .
i am heartily glad i came hither to you  .
i 'm very glad i came to see you  .
if he come tomorrow  , i 'll give him his payment  .
if he shows up tomorrow  , i 'll give him what 's coming to him  .
if ever he go alone again  , i 'll never wrestle for prize more  .
if he can manage to walk after our fight  , i 'll never wrestle for money again  .
and so god keep your worship  .
farewell  , my lord  .
farewell  , good charles  .
take care  , charles  .
i pray thee  , rosalind  , sweet my coz  , be merry  .
please  , rosalind  , my sweet cousin be happy  .
dear celia  , i show more mirth than i am mistress of  , and would you yet i were merrier  ?
dear celia i already look much happier than i feel  , but you want me to look even happier  ?
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father  , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure  .
unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father  , you should n't try to teach me how to be happy  .
herein i see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that i love thee  .
well  , by this i can see that you do n't love me as much as i love you  .
if my uncle  , thy banished father  , had banished thy uncle  , the duke my father  , so thou hadst been still with me  , i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine  .
if father had banished my father  , i could have learned to love your father as my own  , as long as i still had you  .
so wouldst thou  , if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee  .
you 'd do the same  , if your love for me were as true as mine for you  .
well  , i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours  .
well  , i 'll just forget the difficulties of my situation  , in order to focus on the happiness of yours  .
from henceforth i will  , coz  , and devise sports  .
from now on i will  , cousin  , and i 'll think of all kinds of games for us  .
let me see what think you of falling in love  ?
let me see what do you think about falling in love  ?
what shall be our sport  , then  ?
well  , then  , what should we do for fun instead  ?
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel  , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally  .
let 's go find that hussy  , fortune  , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally  .
i would we could do so  , for her benefits are mightily misplaced  , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women  .
i wish we could do that  , because fortune gives all of her gifts to the wrong people  , and she especially gets things wrong where women are concerned  .
't is true  , for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest  , and those that she makes honest she makes very ill - favoredly  .
it 's true  : the women she makes beautiful she also makes slutty  , and the women she makes pure and virginal she also makes ugly  .
no  ?
oh  , really  ?
when nature hath made a fair creature  , may she not by fortune fall into the fire  ?
well  , when nature makes a person beautiful  , ca n't fortune make her fall into a fire  , thereby making her ugly after all  ?
though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune  , hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument  ?
and even though nature has given us the wit to have this argument  , has n't fortune sent this fool here to stop us  ?
indeed  , there is fortune too hard for nature  , when fortune makes nature 's natural the cutter - off of nature 's wit  .
yes  , and now fortune is playing a nasty trick on nature  : she 's breaking up a show of wit between two naturally witty women with the arrival of a natural fool  .
mistress  , you must come away to your father  .
mistress  , you have to go see your father  .
were you made the messenger  ?
did they make you the messenger  ?
no  , by mine honor  , but i was bid to come for you  .
no  , by my honor  , but they told me to come  .
where learned you that oath  , fool  ?
where 'd you learn a phrase like  , by my honor  , fool  ?
of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes  , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught  .
from a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good  , and that the mustard on top of them he swore on his honor was bad  .
now  , i 'll stand to it  , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good  , and yet was not the knight forsworn  .
now  , i 'll swear to the opposite that the pancakes were rotten  , and the mustard was fine but even so  , the knight was n't lying  .
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge  ?
and how  , out of your great heap of knowledge  , will you manage to prove that  ?
ay  , marry  , now unmuzzle your wisdom  .
yes  , please  ; unleash your wisdom  .
stand you both forth now  : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave  .
watch me  : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave  .
by our beards  ( if we had them  )  , thou art  .
by our beards  ( if we had them  )  , you are a knave  .
prithee  , who is 't that thou mean'st  ?
tell me  , who is this knight  ?
one that old frederick  , your father  , loves  .
a man old frederick  , your father  , loves  .
my father 's love is enough to honor him  .
if he has my father 's love  , then that 's enough honor for me  .
enough  .
enough of this  .
speak no more of him  ; you 'll be whipped for taxation one of these days  .
no more talk about my father  ; you 'll be whipped for slander one of these days  .
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly  .
it 's a pity that fools are n't allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do  .

i could match this beginning with an old tale  .
it sounds like the beginning of an old folktale  .
three proper young men of excellent growth and presence  .
three proper young men  , all good looking and with great presence
with bills on their necks  : be it known unto all men by these presents  .
right  , and they wore proclamations around their necks  , saying  , be it known to all men by these
alas  !
oh  , dear  !
but what is the sport  , monsieur  , that the ladies have lost  ?
but tell me  , monsieur what sport are the ladies missing  ?
why  , this that i speak of  .
why  , the one i just told you about  .
or i  , i promise thee  .
me too  , i swear  .
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides  ?

does anyone else love rib breaking  ?

i 'm proud to be sir rowland 's son his youngest son and i would never change that  , not even to be frederick 's adopted heir  .
my father loved sir rowland as his soul  , and all the world was of my father 's mind  .
my father loved sir rowland as much as he loved his own soul  , and the rest of the world shared my father 's opinion  .
had i before known this young man his son  , i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have ventured  .
if i had known this young man was his son  , i would have tried harder to convince him not to fight  .
gentle cousin  , let us go thank him and encourage him  .
gentle cousin  , let 's go thank him and encourage him  .
my father 's rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart  .
my my father 's rude and envious behavior is like a knife through my heart  .
sir  , you have well deserved  .
orlando sir  , you fought very well  .
if you do keep your promises in love but justly  , as you have exceeded all promise  , your mistress shall be happy  .
if you live up to your potential in love as well  , your wife will be a very happy woman  .
ay  .
yes  .

will you come on  , cousin  ?

i 'm coming  .
fare you well  .
farewell  .
good sir  , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place  .
good sir  , as a friend  , i advise you to leave this place  .
albeit you have deserved high commendation  , true applause  , and love  , yet such is now the duke 's condition that he misconsters all that you have done  .
although you deserve praise  , applause  , and love  , right now the duke misconstrues everything you 've done  .
the duke is humorous  .
the duke is temperamental  .
what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of  .
i 'm sure you can imagine what i mean without my having to spell it out  .
i rest much bounden to you  .
i 'm indebted to you  .
fare you well  .
goodbye  .
thus must i from the smoke into the smother  , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother  .
out of the frying pan and into the fire from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother  !
but heavenly rosalind  !
but  , oh  , heavenly rosalind  !
why  , cousin  !
what 's going on  , rosalind  ?
why  , rosalind  !
cupid have mercy  !
cupid have mercy  , not a word  ?
you wo n't utter a single word  ?
not one to throw at a dog  .
i do n't even have one to throw at a dog  .
no  , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs  .
no  , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs  .
throw some of them at me  .
throw some of your words at me  .
come  , lame me with reasons  .
come on  , throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog  .
then there were two cousins laid up  , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any  .
then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed  : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any  .
but is all this for your father  ?
is all of this about your father  ?
no  , some of it is for my child 's father  .
no  , some of it is about my child 's father  .
oh  , how full of briers is this working - day world  !
oh  , this world is full of thorns  !
they are but burs  , cousin  , thrown upon thee in holiday foolery  .
they 're only burrs  , cousin  , thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior  .
if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them  .
if we walk on the well - worn paths  , they wo n't get caught in our petticoats  .
hem them away  .
cough them up  .
i would try  , if i could cry hem and have him  .
i 'd try it  , if i could cry hem and have him  .
come  , come  , wrestle with thy affections  .
come on  , take control of your feelings  .
oh  , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself  .
but they 're siding with a better wrestler than myself  .
oh  , a good wish upon you  .
oh  , that 's a good wish  !
you will try in time  , in despite of a fall  .
you 'll fight with him eventually  , and  .
but turning these jests out of service  , let us talk in good earnest  .
but let 's put these jokes aside for a moment  , and speak earnestly  .
is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland 's youngest son  ?
is it possible that you could have fallen in love with orlando  , sir rowland 's youngest son  , this suddenly  ?
the duke my father loved his father dearly  .
the duke  , my father  , loved his father very much  .
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly  ?
does that necessarily mean you should love his son  ?
by this kind of chase i should hate him  , for my father hated his father dearly  .
by that kind of logic  , i should hate orlando  , since my father hates his father  .
yet i hate not orlando  .
but i do n't hate orlando  .
no  , faith  , hate him not  , for my sake  .
no  , please do n't hate him for my sake  .
why should i not  ?
why should n't i  ?
doth he not deserve well  ?
does n't he deserve it  ?
let me love him for that  , and do you love him because i do  .
let me love him because he deserves it  , and you can love him because i do  .
look  , here comes the duke  .
look  , here comes the duke  .
with his eyes full of anger  .
he looks angry  .
mistress  , dispatch you with your safest haste  , and get you from our court  .
madam  , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court  .
me  , uncle  ?
me  , uncle  ?
you  , cousin  .
you  , niece  .
within these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles  , thou diest for it  .
in ten days time  , if you 're found within twenty miles of the court  , you 'll die for it  .
i do beseech your grace  , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me  .
please  , your grace  , tell me what crime i have committed  .
if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires  , if that i do not dream or be not frantic as i do trust i am not then  , dear uncle  , never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness  .
if i know my own thoughts and desires  , and i 'm not dreaming or crazy which i 'm sure i 'm not then  , dear uncle  , i 've never had so much as a half - formed thought that would have offended you  .
thou art thy father 's daughter  .
you are your father 's daughter  .
there 's enough  .
that 's enough  .
dear sovereign  , hear me speak  .
dear master  , listen to me  .
ay  , celia  , we stayed her for your sake  .
yes  , celia  , we kept her here for your sake  .
else had she with her father ranged along  .
otherwise  , she would have been banished with her father  .
i did not then entreat to have her stay  .
at that time  , i did n't beg you to keep her here  ; you wanted her here  , and you felt guilty  .
it was your pleasure and your own remorse  .
i was too young at the time to appreciate her value  , but now i know her  .
i was too young that time to value her  , but now i know her  .
if she 's a traitor  , why then  , so am i .
if she be a traitor  , why so am i .
we have always slept together  , woken up together  , learned  , played  , and eaten together  .
we still have slept together  , rose at an instant  , learned  , played  , eat together  , and  , wheresoe'er we went  , like juno 's swans still we went coupled and inseparable  .
wherever we went  , we went together and inseparable  .
pronounce that sentence then on me  , my liege  .
then lay that sentence on me too  , my lord  .
i can not live out of her company  .
i can not live without her  .
you are a fool  .
you are a fool  .
you  , niece  , provide yourself  .
you  , niece  , prepare to leave  .
if you outstay the time  , upon mine honor and in the greatness of my word  , you die  .
on my honor and by my word  , if you outstay the ten days  , you will die  .
o my poor rosalind  , whither wilt thou go  ?
oh  , my poor rosalind  , where will you go  ?
wilt thou change fathers  ?
do you want to exchange fathers  ?
i will give thee mine  .
i 'll give you mine  .
i charge thee  , be not thou more grieved than i am  .
i insist  , do n't be more distressed than i am  .
i have more cause  .
i have more reason to be distressed  .
thou hast not  , cousin  .
no you have n't  , cousin  .
prithee  , be cheerful  .
please  , be cheerful  .
know'st thou not the duke hath banished me  , his daughter  ?
do n't you realize the duke has also banished me  , his daughter  ?
that he hath not  .
no  , he has n't  .
why  , whither shall we go  ?
but where will we go  ?
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden  .
to the forest of arden  , to find your father  .
alas  , what danger will it be to us  , maids as we are  , to travel forth so far  ?
but what danger we 'll put ourselves in  , two young  , innocent women traveling so far  !
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold  .
fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money  .
what shall i call thee when thou art a man  ?
what should i call you when you 're a man  ?
but  , cousin  , what if we assayed to steal the clownish fool out of your father 's court  ?
cousin  , what if we brought that clownish fool of your father 's court  , touchstone  ?
would he not be a comfort to our travel  ?
would n't he be a comfort to us in our travels  ?
i would not change it  .
i would n't change my situation for anything  .
happy is your grace  , that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style  .
you 're lucky  , my lord  , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you  .
come  , shall we go and kill us venison  ?
come  , shall we hunt some deer for dinner  ?
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools  , being native burghers of this desert city  , should in their own confines with forkd heads have their round haunches gored  .
it bothers me  , though  , that these poor spotted innocents  , who  , after all  , are this deserted city 's native citizens  , should be gouged with arrows  .
but what said jaques  ?
and what did jaques say  ?
did he not moralize this spectacle  ?
did n't he take the opportunity to draw a moral from the scene  ?
and did you leave him in this contemplation  ?
and did you leave him like this  ?
we did  , my lord  , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer  .
we did  , my lord  , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer  .
show me the place  .
take me to him  .
i love to cope him in these sullen fits  , for then he 's full of matter  .
i love to argue with him when he 's having one of these fits  , because then he always has a lot to say  .
i 'll bring you to him straight  .
i 'll bring you to him right away  .
can it be possible that no man saw them  ?
can it be possible that no one saw them leave  ?
it can not be  .
it can not be  .
some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this  .
some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen  .
i can not hear of any that did see her  .
i ca n't find anyone who saw her leave  .
the ladies  , her attendants of her chamber saw her abed  , and in the morning early they found the bed untreasured of their mistress  .
her ladies - in - waiting saw her go to bed  , and early this morning the bed was empty  .
send to his brother  .
send a message to his brother  .
fetch that gallant hither  .
bring that swinger orlando here  .
if he be absent  , bring his brother to me  .
if he 's not around  , bring his brother oliver to me  .
i 'll make him find him  .
i 'll make oliver find him  .
do this suddenly  , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways  .
do this immediately  , and do n't stop searching and interrogating until you 've brought home these foolish runaways  .
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?
why  , what 's the matter  ?
why  , what 's the matter  ?
why  , whither  , adam  , wouldst thou have me go  ?
then where would you have me go  , adam  ?
no matter whither  , so you come not here  .
it does n't matter where  , so long as it 's not here  .
what  , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food  , or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road  ?
what  , would you have me beg for my food  ?
this i must do  , or know not what to do  .
or become a lowlife  , sticking up travelers on the road  ?
yet this i will not do  , do how i can  .
this is all that 's left for me to do  , but i wo n't do it  .
i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother  .
i 'd rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers  .
but do not so  .
but do n't do that  .
i have five hundred crowns  , the thrifty hire i saved under your father  , which i did store to be my foster nurse when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown  .
i have five - hundred gold coins  , which i carefully saved when i was working for your late father  .
take that  , and he that doth the ravens feed  , yea  , providently caters for the sparrow  , be comfort to my age  .
i meant to use it for my retirement  , to help me when my old body was lame and forgotten in some dark corner  .
here is the gold  .
but take the money  , and god  , who feeds even the raven and looks after even the sparrow  , will comfort me in my old age  .
all this i give you  .
here is the gold  , i give it all to you  .
let me be your servant  .
let me be your servant  .
though i look old  , yet i am strong and lusty  , for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility  .
i know i may be old  , but i 'm strong and healthy  , because in my youth i never drank nor lived recklessly  .
therefore my age is as a lusty winter  , frosty but kindly  .
therefore  , my old age is like a blustery winter  : cold  , but kindly  .
let me go with you  .
let me go with you  .
i 'll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities  .
i 'll do everything a younger man could do for you  .
master  , go on  , and i will follow thee to the last gasp  , with truth and loyalty  .
go on  , master  , and i will follow you with truth and loyalty to my last breath  .
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here livd i  , but now live here no more  .
from the time i was seventeen  , over sixty years ago  , i have lived in this house  , but now i will live here no more  .
at seventeen years  , many their fortunes seek  , but at fourscore  , it is too late a week  .
many men seek their fortune at seventeen  ; at eighty  , it 's a bit late  .
yet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well  , and not my master 's debtor  .
but fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well  , without owing my master anything  .
o jupiter  , how weary are my spirits  !
oh lord  , my spirits are tired  !
i care not for my spirits  , if my legs were not weary  .
i would n't care about my spirits  , if my legs were n't tired  .
i could find in my heart to disgrace my man 's apparel and to cry like a woman  , but i must comfort the weaker vessel  , as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat  .
i 'd insult my manly wardrobe by weeping like a woman if i did n't have to comfort the weaker vessel here  , as the ought to be brave for the sake of the petticoat  .
therefore courage  , good aliena  .
so  , have courage  , good aliena  .
i pray you bear with me  .
please bear with me  .
i can not go no further  .
i ca n't go any further  .
for my part  , i had rather bear with you than bear you  .
i 'd rather bear with you than you  .
yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you  , for i think you have no money in your purse  .
but if i did carry you  , it would be no to bear  , because i 'm pretty sure you do n't have any money  .
well  , this is the forest of arden  .
well  , this is the forest of arden  .
ay  , be so  , good touchstone  .
yes  , be content  , good touchstone  .
look you who comes here  , a young man and an old in solemn talk  .
look who 's coming  : a young man and an old man  , having a serious talk  .
that is the way to make her scorn you still  .
what you 're doing is the way to make her scorn you continually  .
o corin  , that thou knew'st how i do love her  !
oh  , corin  , i wish you could understand how much i love her  !
no  , corin  , being old  , thou canst not guess  , though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighed upon a midnight pillow  .
no corin  , since you 're old  , you can not guess even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was  , sighing and mooning all night long  .
but if thy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy  ?
if your love was anything like mine and i 'm sure that no man has loved as i love now exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to  ?
into a thousand that i have forgotten  .
oh  , a thousand of them  , all of which i 've forgotten  .
oh  , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily  .
oh  , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me  .
if thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into  , thou hast not loved  .
if you ca n't remember the stupidest little thing love made you do  , you have n't loved  .
or if thou hast not sat as i do now  , wearying thy hearer in thy mistress 's praise  , thou hast not loved  .
or if you have n't sat as i do now  , boring your listener with all your lover 's virtues  , then you have n't loved  .
or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly  , as my passion now makes me  , thou hast not loved  .
or if you have n't broken away from human company  , as my feelings now lead me to do  , you have n't loved  .
o phoebe  , phoebe  , phoebe  !

i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a - night to jane smile  .
i remember when i was in love  , i broke my sword on a stone  , and told him to take that for coming at night to see jane smile  .
and i remember the kissing of her batler  , and the cow 's dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked  .
i remember kissing her washing stick and the cow 's udders that her pretty  , chapped hands had milked  .
and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her  , from whom i took two cods and  , giving her them again  , said with weeping tears  , wear these for my sake  .
i remember wooing a pea plant in her name  , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them for my sake  .
we that are true lovers run into strange capers  .
those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things  .
but as all is mortal in nature  , so is all nature in love mortal in folly  .
but everything that lives is mortal  , including the foolishness of love  .
thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of  .
you speak more wisely than you know  .
nay  , i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it  .
nah  , i 'll never be aware of my own wit  , until i break my shins on it  .
and mine  , but it grows something stale with me  .
and like mine  , but i 'm getting a little tired of it  .
i pray you  , one of you question yond man  , if he for gold will give us any food  .

if this uncouth forest yield anything savage  , i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee  .
if i can find any animal in this wild forest  , i 'll either be food for it or bring it as food for you  .
thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers  .
you 're not as close to death as you think you are  .
for my sake  , be comfortable  .
for my sake  , make yourself comfortable  ; keep death at arm 's length for a while  .
hold death awhile at the arm 's end  .
i 'll be back soon  , and if i have n't brought you anything to eat  , i will give you permission to die  .
i will here be with thee presently  , and if i bring thee not something to eat  , i will give thee leave to die  .

my lord  , he is but even now gone hence  .
my lord  , he just left here  .
here was he merry  , hearing of a song  .
he was happy here  , listening to a song  .
if he  , compact of jars  , grow musical  , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres  .
if that man  , who 's made up of conflicts  , becomes musical  , then there must be something wrong with the universe  .
go seek him  .

a worthy fool  !
one that hath been a courtier and says  , if ladies be but young and fair  , they have the gift to know it  .
he 's been a courtier and says  , if ladies are young and pretty  , they always know it  .
and in his brain  , which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage  , he hath strange places crammed with observation  , the which he vents in mangled forms  .
his is dry as a sailor 's biscuit and crammed with all sorts of strange observations  , which he presents in mangled fashion  .

fie on thee  !
to hell with you  !
i can tell what thou wouldst do  .
i know what you 'd do  .
what  , for a counter  , would i do but good  ?
what would i do besides good  ?
most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin  , for thou thyself hast been a libertine  , as sensual as the brutish sting itself  , and all th ' embossd sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world  .
you would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning  , because you yourself have been a terrible sinner  , as carnal in your appetites as lust itself  , and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large  .
why  , who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party  ?
but if i cry out against pride in general  , how can anyone say i 'm accusing a particular person  ?

i would fain see this meeting  .
this i 'd like to see  .
well  , the gods give us joy  .
well  , god bless this marriage  !
is there none here to give the woman  ?
is there anyone to give the bride away  ?
i will not take her on gift of any man  .
i do n't want to take another man 's second - hand goods  .
truly  , she must be given  , or the marriage is not lawful  .
no  , someone has to give her away or the marriage is n't legal  .
will you be married  , motley  ?
do you want to get married  , fool  ?
as the ox hath his bow  , sir  , the horse his curb  , and the falcon her bells  , so man hath his desires  ; and as pigeons bill  , so wedlock would be nibbling  .
just as the ox has his yoke  , the horse its bridle  , the falcon a tether  , a man has his desires to keep in check  .
and will you  , being a man of your breeding  , be married under a bush like a beggar  ?
and  , being a man of your breeding  , you 're going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar  ?
get you to church  , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is  .
get yourself to a church and have a proper priest  , who can tell you what marriage is all about  , marry you  .
this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot  .
this man here will slap you two together like two pieces of wood panelling  .
then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and  , like green timber  , warp  , warp  .
then one of you will warp and pull away and there goes your marriage  .
i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another  , for he is not like to marry me well  , and not being well married  , it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife  .
i 'd rather have this guy marry us  , because he is not likely to marry us well  , and if we 're not married properly  , i 'll have a better excuse later to leave my wife  .
go thou with me  , and let me counsel thee  .
come with me and let me advise you  .
't is no matter  .
it does n't matter to me  .
ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling  .
none of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession  .
never talk to me  .
do n't talk to me  .
i will weep  .
i 'm going to cry  .
do  , i prithee  , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man  .
go ahead if you want  , but remember that crying does n't suit a man  .
but have i not cause to weep  ?
but do n't i have good reason to cry  ?
as good cause as one would desire  .
as good a reason as any  .
therefore weep  .
so go ahead and cry  .
his very hair is of the dissembling color  .
i mean  , his is even red the same color as that lying judas  .
i ' faith  , his hair is of a good color  .
no  , really  , his hair is a nice color  .
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread  .
his kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest  .
but why did he swear he would come this morning  , and comes not  ?
but why would he promise to come visit me this morning and then not come  ?
nay  , certainly  , there is no truth in him  .
really  , he 's a total liar  .
do you think so  ?
do you think so  ?
not true in love  ?
you think his feelings are n't true  ?
you have heard him swear downright he was  .
but you heard him swear up and down that he was  .
who comes here  ?
who 's coming here  ?
mistress and master  , you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complained of love  , who you saw sitting by me on the turf  , praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress  .
mistress and master  , you 've often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with  , the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with  .
well  , and what of him  ?
yes  , what about him  ?
if you will see a pageant truly played between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain  , go hence a little  , and i shall conduct you  , if you will mark it  .
if you 'd like to see a scene played out between a man growing pale with unrequited love and a woman glowing with scorn and proud disdain  , come with me a short distance and you 'll witness it  .
celia o  , come  , let us remove  .
celia come on  , let 's go  .
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love  .
the sight of lovers nourishes whoever else is in love  .
bring us to this sight  , and you shall say i 'll prove a busy actor in their play  .
corin bring us to this little show  , and i 'll take a part in their play  .
sweet phoebe  , do not scorn me  .
sweet phoebe  , do not scorn me  .
do not  , phoebe  .
do not  , phoebe  .
say that you love me not  , but say not so in bitterness  .
go ahead and say you do n't love me  , but not so bitterly  .
the common executioner  , whose heart th ' accustomed sight of death makes hard  , falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon  .
the executioner  , who 's seen death so much his heart has grown hard  , still says  , forgive me before he drops the axe on the criminal 's neck  .
will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops  ?
are you going to be crueler than the man who makes his living by killing  ?
o dear phoebe  , if ever as that ever may be near you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy  , then shall you know the wounds invisible that love 's keen arrows make  .
oh  , darling phoebe  , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face  , then you 'll know about the invisible wounds that love 's sharp arrows can make  .
but till that time come not thou near me  .
well  , until that time  , do n't come near me  .
and when that time comes  , afflict me with thy mocks  , pity me not  , as till that time i shall not pity thee  .
and when that time comes  , then you can mock me  , but please do n't pity me  , because i wo n't pity you  .
but  , mistress  , know yourself  .
but mistress  , know yourself  .
down on your knees and thank heaven  , fasting  , for a good man 's love  , for i must tell you friendly in your ear  , sell when you can  ; you are not for all markets  .
get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man  .
cry the man mercy  , love him  , take his offer  .
i 'm telling you  , as a friend  , that you should sell while the market 's good you 're not going to have many more buyers  .
foul is most foul  , being foul to be a scoffer  .
ask this man 's forgiveness  , love him  , and accept his offer  .
so take her to thee  , shepherd  .
you 're already ugly  , do n't make matters worse by being scornful  , too  .
fare you well  .
so take her  , shepherd  , and god bless you  .
he 's fall'n in love with your foulness  .
he 's fallen in love with your sheer ugliness  .
silvius and she 'll fall in love with my anger  .
silvius and i think she 's falling in love with my anger  .
if it be so  , as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks  , i 'll sauce her with bitter words  .
if i 'm right  , as soon as she answers you with frowns  , i 'll rebuke her with bitter words  .
phoebe why look you so upon me  ?
phoebe why are you looking at me like that  ?
for no ill will i bear you  .
i do n't wish you any harm  .
dead shepherd  , now i find thy saw of might  : who ever loved that loved not at first sight  ?
dead  , now i understand what you meant when you said  , you 've never loved until you 've fallen in love at first sight  .
sweet phoebe
sweet phoebe
sweet phoebe  , pity me  .
sweet phoebe  , have pity on me  .
why  , i am sorry for thee  , gentle silvius  .
well  , i 'm sorry for you  , gentle silvius  .
thou hast my love  .
you have my friendship  .
is not that neighborly  ?
is n't that enough  ?
i would have you  .
i want you  .
so holy and so perfect is my love  , and i in such a poverty of grace  , that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps  .
my love for you is so pure and perfect  , and i 'm in such a bad way  , that i 'll be grateful for whatever leftover love you throw my way  .
loose now and then a scattered smile  , and that i 'll live upon  .
every once in a while  , toss me a distracted smile  , and i 'll live on that  .
know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile  ?
do you know the boy who was just speaking to me  ?
phoebe  , with all my heart  .
with all my heart  , phoebe  .
i prithee  , pretty youth  , let me be better acquainted with thee  .
please  , pretty young man  , i 'd like to get to know you better  .
they say you are a melancholy fellow  .
they say you are a melancholy fellow  .
i am so  .
i am  .
i do love it better than laughing  .
i like it better than laughing  .
why  , 't is good to be sad and say nothing  .
well  , i think it 's good to be serious and keep quiet  .
why then  , 't is good to be a post  .
in that case it 's good to be a post  .
a traveler  .
you 're a traveler  .
by my faith  , you have great reason to be sad  .
well then  , you have good reason to be sad  .
i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men 's  .
i 'm afraid you 've sold your own land to see other men 's  .
then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands  .
to have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands  .
and your experience makes you sad  .
and your experience makes you sad  .
i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it  , too  .
i 'd rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad and to travel for all that trouble  , no less  !
good day and happiness  , dear rosalind  .
good day and happiness to you  , darling rosalind  .
nay then  , god be wi ' you  , an you talk in blank verse  .
no i 'll say goodbye if you 're going to talk in  .
my fair rosalind  , i come within an hour of my promise  .
my beautiful rosalind  , i 'm only an hour late  .
break an hour 's promise in love  ?
you 'd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour  ?
he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love  , it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o ' th ' shoulder  , but i 'll warrant him heart - whole  .
a man who will dare to meet his lover even a thousandth part of a minute late well  , it 's possible he likes her  , but i doubt he really loves the woman  .
pardon me  , dear rosalind  .
forgive me  , darling rosalind  .
nay  , an you be so tardy  , come no more in my sight  .
no  , if you 're ever late like this again  , i 'll refuse to see you  .
i had as lief be wooed of a snail  .
i 'd rather be wooed by a snail  .
of a snail  ?
a snail  ?
what 's that  ?
what fate is that  ?
why  , horns  , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for  .
why  , his cuckold 's horns  , of course the kind you men are always blaming on your wives  .
but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife  .
see  , the snail already has its horns  , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife 's infidelity  .
virtue is no hornmaker  , and my rosalind is virtuous  .
a virtuous woman wo n't give her husband horns  , and my rosalind is definitely virtuous  .
and i am your rosalind  .
and i am your rosalind  .
it pleases him to call you so  , but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you  .
he likes calling you that  , but he 's got another rosalind out there with a prettier face  .
i would kiss before i spoke  .
i 'd kiss you before i spoke  .
nay  , you were better speak first  , and when you were graveled for lack of matter  , you might take occasion to kiss  .
no  , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you 've run out of things to say  .
very good orators  , when they are out  , they will spit  ; and for lovers lacking god warn us matter  , the cleanliest shift is to kiss  .
when good orators finish talking  , they spit  ; when lovers do  ( god help us if they ever do  )  , they kiss  .
how if the kiss be denied  ?
what if she wo n't kiss me  ?
then she puts you to entreaty  , and there begins new matter  .
then she 's making you beg  , and that gives you a whole new set of things to talk about  .
who could be out  , being before his beloved mistress  ?
who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves  ?
marry  , that should you if i were your mistress  , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit  .
indeed  , you would be out if i were your mistress if my chastity is worth as much as my wit  .
what  , of my suit  ?
would i be out of my  ?
not out of your apparel  , and yet out of your suit  .
no  , you 'd still have your clothes on but  , yes  , i would n't think much of you  .
am not i your rosalind  ?
are n't i your rosalind  ?
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her  .
i like to pretend you are  , because then it 's almost like actually talking to her  .
well  , in her person i say i will not have you  .
well  , on behalf of rosalind  , i 'll tell you i do n't want you  .
then  , in mine own person i die  .
then  , on behalf of myself  , i 'll tell you i 'll die  .
then love me  , rosalind  .
then love me  , rosalind  .
yes  , faith  , will i  , fridays and saturdays and all  .
okay  , i will on fridays and saturdays  , and the rest  .
and wilt thou have me  ?
and will you have me  ?
ay  , and twenty such  .
sure  , and twenty others just like you  .
what sayest thou  ?
what 's that  ?
are you not good  ?
well  , are n't you a good man  ?
i hope so  .
i hope so  .
why then  , can one desire too much of a good thing  ?
and can a person ever have too much of a good thing  ?
come  , sister  , you shall be the priest and marry us  .
come on  , sister  , you can be the priest and marry us  .
give me your hand  , orlando  .
give me your hand  , orlando  .
what do you say  , sister  ?
what do you say  , sister  ?
pray thee  , marry us  .
please  , marry us  .
i can not say the words  .
i ca n't say the  .
you must begin will you  , orlando
you just have to say  , do you  , orlando
go to  .
oh  , stop it  .
will you  , orlando  , have to wife this rosalind  ?
do you  , orlando  , take rosalind to be your lawfully wedded wife  ?
i will  .
i do  .
ay  , but when  ?
okay  , but when  ?
why  , now  , as fast as she can marry us  .
right now  ; as fast as she can say the vows  .
then you must say i take thee  , rosalind  , for wife  .
then you have to say  , i take you  , rosalind  , to be my lawfully wedded wife  .
i take thee  , rosalind  , for wife  .
i take you  , rosalind  , to be my lawfully wedded wife  .
so do all thoughts  .
so do all thoughts  .
they are winged  .
they have wings  .
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her  .
now tell me how long you intend to keep her  .
forever and a day  .
forever and a day  .
say a day without the ever  .
you might as well just say for a day  , and forget the ever part  .
no  , no  , orlando  , men are april when they woo  , december when they wed .
no  , orlando  , men are like april when they 're wooing a girl young  , and passionate but like december once they 're married and their passions have cooled  .
maids are may when they are maids  , but the sky changes when they are wives  .
women are as sweet and temperate as springtime when they 're single  , but the climate changes once they 're married  .
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock - pigeon over his hen  , more clamorous than a parrot against rain  , more newfangled than an ape  , more giddy in my desires than a monkey  .
i 'll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen  ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain  ; more fond of new things than an ape  ; more giddy about getting what i want than a monkey  .
i will weep for nothing  , like diana in the fountain  , and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry  .
i 'll cry at nothing  , and i 'll always do it when you 're in a good mood  .
i will laugh like a hyena  , and that when thou art inclined to sleep  .
and when you want to go to sleep  , i 'll be up laughing like a hyena  .
but will my rosalind do so  ?
but will my rosalind do this  , too  ?
by my life  , she will do as i do  .
indeed  , she 'll act just like me  .
oh  , but she is wise  .
but she is wise  .
a man that had a wife with such a wit  , he might say wit  , whither wilt  ?
a man with a wife like that might ask  , hey  , wandering wit  , where are you off to  ?
nay  , you might keep that check for it  , till you met your wife 's wit going to your neighbor 's bed  .
nah  , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor 's bed  .
and what wit could wit have to excuse that  ?
and what wit could excuse  ?
for these two hours  , rosalind  , i will leave thee  .
rosalind  , i have to leave you for two hours  .
i must attend the duke at dinner  .
i must join the duke for lunch  .
by two o'clock i will be with thee again  .
i 'll be back here with you by two o'clock  .
ay  , sweet rosalind  .
yes  , sweet rosalind  .
by my troth  , and in good earnest  , and so god mend me  , and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous  , if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour  , i will think you the most pathetical break - promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful  .
honestly  , truly  , in god 's name  , and by all those little girly oaths that do n't actually have any power  , if you break even a little bit of your promise  , or if you come even a minute after two o'clock  , i 'll think you the most pathetic promise breaker  , the most lying lover  , and the most unworthy partner for rosalind that could be found anywhere  .
therefore beware my censure  , and keep your promise  .
so beware of my contempt  , and keep your promise  .
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind  .
i 'll keep my promise just as if you really were rosalind  .
so  , adieu  .
so  , goodbye  .
you have simply misused our sex in your love - prate  .
you have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours  .
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest  .
we should rip off your man 's clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly  .
or rather bottomless  , that as fast as you pour affection in  , it runs out  .
or it 's bottomless  , at least  : pour affection in one end  , and it runs out the other  .
no  , that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought  , conceived of spleen  , and born of madness  , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone 's eyes because his own are out  , let him be judge how deep i am in love  .
cupid that blind bastard son of venus  , conceived from a thought and anger  , born from insanity  , that blind  , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he ca n't see himself let cupid judge how deep my love runs  .
i 'll tell thee  , aliena  , i can not be out of the sight of orlando  .
i 'm telling you  , aliena  , i ca n't stand being apart from orlando  .
i 'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come  .
i 'm going to find some shade and sigh until he returns  .
and i 'll sleep  .
and i 'm going to sleep  .
which is he that killed the deer  ?
which one of you killed the deer  ?
sir  , it was i  .
it was me  , sir  .
let 's present him to the duke like a roman conqueror  .
let 's bring this man to the duke  , like a triumphant roman conqueror  .
and it would do well to set the deer 's horns upon his head for a branch of victory  .
put the deer 's horns on his head  , like a victory branch  .
have you no song  , forester  , for this purpose  ?
do you have a song  , forester  , for this occasion  ?
yes  , sir  .
yes  , sir  .
sing it  .
then sing it  .
't is no matter how it be in tune  , so it make noise enough  .
it does n't matter if it 's in tune so long as it 's loud enough  .
how say you now  ?
what do you say now  ?
is it not past two o'clock  ?
is n't it past two o'clock  ?
and here much orlando  .
and i see a lot of orlando here  .
i warrant you  , with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep  .
i 'm telling you  , he 's taken his bow and arrows and  , with a pure love and a worried brain  , has gone to take a nap  .
look who comes here  .
look who 's coming  .
no  , i protest  , i know not the contents  .
no  , i swear  , i do n't even know what 's in it  .
phoebe did write it  .
phoebe wrote it  .
sure it is hers  .
i 'm telling you  , it 's hers  .
why  , 't is a boisterous and a cruel style  , a style for challengers  .
well  , it 's written in a boisterous and rude style someone is up for a fight  .
why  , she defies me like turk to christian  .
why  , she challenges me like a muslim would challenge a christian  .
women 's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant - rude invention  , such ethiop words  , blacker in their effect than in their countenance  .
no  , a woman 's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings  .
will you hear the letter  ?
do you want to hear what she says  ?
so please you  , for i never heard it yet  , yet heard too much of phoebe 's cruelty  .
if you want to read it  , as i have n't heard it yet  , though i 've heard too much of phoebe 's cruelty  .
she phoebes me  .
she 's phoebe - ing me  .
mark how the tyrant writes  .
listen to what the tyrant says  .
art thou god to shepherd turned  , that a maiden 's heart hath burned  ?
are you a god disguised as a shepherd  , that you know so expertly how to burn my heart  ?
can a woman rail thus  ?
now  , honestly  , would a woman rant like this  ?
call you this railing  ?
you call that ranting  ?
why  , thy godhead laid apart  , warr'st thou with a woman 's heart  ?
why have you set aside your divine nature just to battle with a woman 's affections  ?
did you ever hear such railing  ?
did you ever hear such ranting  ?
whiles the eye of man did woo me  , that could do no vengeance to me  .
when other men have wooed me  , they did n't hurt me  .
meaning me a beast  .
in other words  , she thinks i 'm not a man  , but an animal  .
call you this chiding  ?
you call this sneering  ?
alas  , poor shepherd  .
oh  , you poor shepherd  !
good morrow  , fair ones  .
good morning  , pretty ones  .
pray you  , if you know  , where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees  ?
tell me  , if you know  : where in this forest is there a shepherd 's cottage surrounded by olive trees  ?
it is no boast  , being asked  , to say we are  .
since you asked  , i suppose it 's not bragging to say that we are  .
orlando doth commend him to you both  , and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin  .
orlando sends his regards to you both  , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls his rosalind  .
are you he  ?
is that you  ?
i am  .
it is  .
what must we understand by this  ?
what does this mean  ?
i pray you  , tell it  .
please  , tell us  .
oh  , i have heard him speak of that same brother  , and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men  .
oh  , i 've heard him talk about that brother  , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive  .
but to orlando  : did he leave him there  , food to the sucked and hungry lioness  ?
but  , back to orlando  , did he leave his brother there  , to be food for the hungry mother - lioness  ?
are you his brother  ?
are you his brother  ?
was 't you he rescued  ?
was it you that he rescued  ?
was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him  ?
was it you that was always plotting to kill him  ?
but for the bloody napkin  ?
but what about the bloody handkerchief  ?
many will swoon when they do look on blood  .
many people faint when they see blood  .
there is more in it  .
there 's more to it than that  .
cousin ganymede  .
ganymede  !
look  , he recovers  .
look  , he 's recovering  .
i would i were at home  .
i want to go home  .

i pray you  , will you take him by the arm  ?
please  , will you take his arm  ?
be of good cheer  , youth  .
buck up  , boy  !
you a man  ?
you 're a man  ?
you lack a man 's heart  .
you do n't have a man 's courage  .
i do so  , i confess it  .
it 's true  , i confess  .
ah  , sirrah  , a body would think this was well - counterfeited  .
oh  , sir  , someone would think i was a good fake  .
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited  .
please tell your brother what a convincing show i put on  .
heigh - ho  .
whoo - hoo  !
this was not counterfeit  .
that was no show  .
there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest  .
your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint  .
counterfeit  , i assure you  .
fake  , i 'm telling you  .
well then  , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man  .
well  , then  , be brave and pretend to be a man  .
so i do  .
that 's what i 'm doing  .
but i ' faith  , i should have been a woman by right  .
but honestly  , i should have been a woman  .
come  , you look paler and paler  .

he 's as good at anything and yet a fool  .

we 'll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end with delight  .
it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue  , but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue  .
you do n't usually see a woman deliver an epilogue  , but it 's no worse than seeing a man deliver the prologue  .
if it be true that good wine needs no bush  , 't is true that a good play needs no epilogue  .
if it 's true that you do n't need to sell good wine  , then it should also be true that a good play does n't need an epilogue  .
yet to good wine they do use good bushes  , and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues  .
but they use good - quality ivy to sell good wine  , and a good play is improved by a good epilogue  .
what a case am i in  , then  , that am neither a good epilogue nor can not insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play  .
but then i 'm in a strange position  , as i not only do not have a good epilogue  , i 'm not sure this was a good play  .
i am not furnished like a beggar  ; therefore to beg will not become me  .
i 'm not dressed like a beggar  , so it would n't be becoming for me to beg  .
my way is to conjure you  , and i 'll begin with the women  .
no  , instead i 'll bewitch you  , and i 'll start with the women  .
i charge you  , o women  , for the love you bear to men  , to like as much of this play as please you  .
women  , in the name of the love you have for men  , i demand that you like as much of this play as you feel like  .
and i charge you  , o men  , for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering  , none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please  .
men  , in the name of the women you love and i can guess by your goofy smiles that none of you exactly hates them the play will act as a nice toy for you and the to share  .
if i were a woman  , i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me  , complexions that liked me  , and breaths that i defied not  .
if i actually were a woman  , i 'd kiss all of you that have beards that pleased me  , complexions that i liked  , and breath that was n't foul  .
and i am sure as many as have good beards  , or good faces  , or sweet breaths will  , for my kind offer  , when i make curtsy  , bid me farewell  .
and i 'm sure that all of you with nice beards  , good faces  , and sweet breath will  , when i curtsy good night  , give me a nice round of applause  .
yet this my comfort  : when your words are done  , my woes end likewise with the evening sun  .
at least i have this comfort  : when you finish speaking  , my troubles will also end  , at sundown  .
well  , syracusian  , say in brief the cause why thou dep - artedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus  .
well  , syracusian  , tell usbrieflywhy you left your hometown and came to ephesus  .
nay  , forward  , old man  .
no  , keep going  , old man  ; do n't stop like that  .
do not break off so  , for we may pity though not pardon thee  .
for we may take pity on you  , even if we ca n't pardon you  .
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for  , do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall'n of them and thee till now  .
and for the sake of those you grieve for  , do me a favor  : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them  , up to this point  .
i will  , my lord  .
i will  .
hopeless and helpless doth egeon wend  , but to procrastinate his lifeless end  .
hopeless and helpless  , i go my way  , merely putting off my fatal end  .
many a man would take you at your word and go indeed  , having so good a mean  .
many men would take you literally and take off with all this money  .
farewell till then  .
farewell till then  .
i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city  .
i will go lose myself  , wandering up and down throughout the city  .

sir  , i leave you to your own contentment  .
here comes the almanac of my true date  .

how is it that you 've come back so soon  ?

tell me this  , i pray  : where have you left the money that i gave you  ?

where 's the gold i gave you  ?
to me  , sir  ?
gave me  , sir  ?
why  , you gave no gold to me  !
you did n't give me any gold  .
my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house  , the phoenix  , sir  , to dinner  .
the only thing that i 've been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house  , the phoenix  , for lunch  .
my mistress and her sister stays for you  .

a man is master of his liberty  ; time is their master  , and when they see time they 'll go or come  .
a man is master of his own freedom  : time is his only master  , and when the right moment comes along  , he 'll come or go as he pleases  .
if so  , be patient  , sister  .
if this is so  , be patient  , sister  .
why should their liberty than ours be more  ?
why should men be more free than women  ?
because their business still lies out o ' door  .

when spake i such a word  ?
when did i say all that  ?
i did not see you since you sent me hence  , home to the centaur with the gold you gave me  .
i have n't seen you since you sent me to the centaur with the gold you gave me  .
i am glad to see you in this merry vein  .
i 'm glad to see you in such a merry mood  .
what means this jest  ?
but what 's the joke  ?
i pray you  , master  , tell me  ?
please  , master  , tell me  .
hold  , sir  , for god 's sake  !
stop  , sir  , for god 's sake  !
now your jest is earnest  .
now this joke has turned serious  .
upon what bargain do you give it me  ?
why are you doing this  ?
sconce call you it  ?
you call it my  ?
so you would leave battering  , i had rather have it a head  .
i 'd rather call it my head so you 'd stop battering it  .
an you use these blows long  , i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too  , or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders  .
if you keep pounding me  , i 'll need a sconce to wrap my head with  , or else i 'll have to keep my brain in my chest  .
but i pray  , sir  , why am i beaten  ?
but sir  , why are you beating me  ?
dost thou not know  ?
do n't you know  ?
nothing  , sir  , but that i am beaten  .
all i know is that i 'm being beaten  .
shall i tell you why  ?
should i tell you why  ?
was there ever any man thus beaten out of season  , when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason  ?
i do n't think any man 's ever been beaten for a why and wherefore that made so little sense  .
well  , sir  , i thank you  .
well  , thank you  .
marry  , sir  , for this something that you gave me for nothing  .
because you gave me something for nothing  .
i 'll make you amends next  , to give you nothing for something  .
next time i 'll give you nothing for something  .
but say  , sir  , is it dinnertime  ?
is it lunchtime  ?
in good time  , sir  , what 's that  ?
what would that be  ?
basting  .
a basting  .
well  , sir  , then 'twill be dry  .
well  , then it will be dry  .
if it be  , sir  , i pray you  , eat none of it  .
if it is  , i suggest you do n't eat it  .
your reason  ?
why not  ?
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting  .
because it will make you angry  , and that will get me another beating  .
well  , sir  , learn to jest in good time  .
well  , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time  .
there 's a time for all things  .
there 's a time for all things  .
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric  .
before you got so angry  , i never would have thought that  .
by what rule  , sir  ?
why not  ?
marry  , sir  , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself  .
i 'll tell you  : it 's because of a law as plain as father time 's bald head  .
let 's hear it  .
let 's hear it  .
there 's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature  .
there may be a time for everything  , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back  .
may he not do it by fine and recovery  ?
ca n't he get it by  ?
yes  , to pay a fine for a periwig  , and recover the lost hair of another man  .
yes  , he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another man 's lost hair  .
why  , but there 's many a man hath more hair than wit  .
but a lot of men have more hair than intelligence  .
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair  .
and not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald  .
why  , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit  .
so then  , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded  .
the plainer dealer  , the sooner lost  .
the more simpleminded they are  , the sooner they  .
yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity  .
but they have a good time doing so  .
for what reason  ?
why  ?
nay  , not sound  , i pray you  .
not good ones  , please  .
sure ones  , then  .
then sure ones  .
nay  , not sure  , in a thing falsing  .
no  , not sure ones when we 're talking about something unsure  .
certain ones  , then  .
then certain ones  .
name them  .
name them  .
the one  , to save the money that he spends in tiring  ; the other  , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge  .
one  , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling  , and two  , so that when their hair falls out it does n't land in their dinner  .
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things  .
you were supposed to be proving that there is n't time for everything  .
but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover  .
you did n't come up with a very good proof  .
thus i mend it  : time himself is bald and therefore  , to the world 's end  , will have bald followers  .
then i 'll change it to this  : father time himself is bald  , so for all time there will be bald men  .
by dromio  ?
dromio  ?
by me  ?
me  ?
did you converse  , sir  , with this gentlewoman  ?
did you talk with this woman  ?

i  , sir  ?
me  , sir  ?
i never saw her till this time  .
i never saw her till now  .
i never spake with her in all my life  .
i never talked with her in my life  .
dromio  , go bid the servants spread for dinner  .
dromio  , tell the servants to prepare for lunch  .
why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not  ?
why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order i gave you  ?
dromio thou  , dromio thou snail  , thou slug  , thou sot  .
dromio  , you drone  , you snail  , you slug  , you idiot  !
i am transformd  , master  , am i not  ?
i 've been transformed somehow  , have n't i  , master  ?
i think thou art in mind  , and so am i  .
i think your mind has been altered  , and mine too  .
nay  , master  , both in mind and in my shape  .
no  , master  , i 've been changed in both mind and body  .
thou hast thine own form  .
your body looks the same  .
no  , i am an ape  .
no  , i 'm an  .
if thou art changed to aught  , 't is to an ass  .
if you 've changed into anything  , it 's an ass  .
known unto these  , and to myself disguised  !
know myself  !

i 'll agree with them and keep with it  , whatever happens  .
master  , shall i be porter at the gate  ?
master  , should i watch the door  ?
ay  ; and let none enter  , lest i break your pate  .

i think thou art an ass  .
i think you 're an ass  .
you 're sad  , signior balthasar  .
signior balthasar  , you look upset  .
pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here  .
i hope the good meal i 'm going to give you will show the goodwill i bear you and how welcome you are  .
i hold your dainties cheap  , sir  , and your welcome dear  .
your delicacies are n't worth as much to me as your welcome is  .
o signior balthasar  , either at flesh or fish a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish  .
signior balthasar  , all the welcome in the world ca n't compare to a good meal  , whatever kind of food it might be  .
good meat  , sir  , is common  ; that every churl affords  .
good food 's not a big deal everyone can afford that  .
and welcome more common  , for that 's nothing but words  .
and everyone can say welcome  , which is just a word  .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast  .
a little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast  .
ay  , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest  .
sure  , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest  .
but though my cates be mean  , take them in good part  .
but look  , even if my dishes are poor  , eat them with my best wishes  .
better cheer may you have  , but not with better heart  .
you may come across better food  , but not a warmer welcome  .
but soft  !

bid them welcome hither  .
tell them they 're welcome  .
there is something in the wind  , that we can not get in  .
there 's something strange in the air that 's keeping us from getting in  .
you would say so  , master  , if your garments were thin  .
and if your clothes were as thin as mine  , you 'd really feel the air  .
your cake there is warm within  ; you stand here in the cold  .
the food inside is warm  , but you 're out here freezing  .
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold  .
it would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this  .

i swore that you would come with the necklace  , but neither you nor the necklace showed up  .
belike you thought our love would last too long if it were chained together  , and therefore came not  .
perhaps you were concerned about being chained to me and so decided not to come  .
then you will bring the chain to her yourself  .
so you 'll bring the necklace to her yourself  ?
well  , sir  , i will  .

every person i meet greets me like an old friend  , and every one of them knows my name  .
some tender money to me  ; some invite me  ; some other give me thanks for kindnesses  ; some offer me commodities to buy  .
some of them give me money  , some invite me places  , some thank me for the kind things i 've done for them  , some try to sell me things  .

pinch is't good to soothe him in these contraries  ?
pinch should i try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies  ?

adriana thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me  .
adriana you convinced the jeweler to arrest me  .

she might have given me her best wishes  , master  , but she did n't give me one scrap of money  .
went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats  ?
did n't you go to her for a purse full of ducats  ?

you saw they speak us fair  , give us gold  .

i think this country is so kind that if it were n't for
that claims marriage of me  , i could find in my heart to stay here still  , and turn witch  .
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me  , i could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself  .
i will not stay tonight for all the town  .
i would n't stay here tonight for the entire town  .
therefore away  , to get our stuff aboard  .
go and get our stuff onto the ship  .
how is the man esteemed here in the city  ?

i knew he was not in his perfect wits  .
second merchant i knew he was n't quite in his right mind  .
i am sorry now that i did draw on him  .
angelo now i 'm sorry i raised my sword against him  .
how long hath this possession held the man  ?
how long has he been possessed like this  ?
this week he hath been heavy  , sour  , sad  , and much different from the man he was  .
this week he was sad  , moody  , and depressed and very different from his usual self  .
but till this afternoon his passion ne'er brake into extremity of rage  .
but it was n't until this afternoon that he broke out into violence  .
you should for that have reprehended him  .
you should have reprimanded him for that  .
why  , so i did  .
i did  .
ay  , but not rough enough  .
fine  , but you were n't harsh enough  .
as roughly as my modesty would let me  .
i was as harsh as i could be while still being a lady  .
haply in private  .
you scolded him in private  ?
and in assemblies too  .
and in public too  .
ay  , but not enough  .
fine  , but not enough  .
and thereof came it that the man was mad  .
and that 's why he went crazy  .
the venom clamors of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog 's tooth  .
a jealous woman 's poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog  .
it seems his sleeps were hinder 'd by thy railing  , and therefore comes it that his head is light  .
you disturbed his sleep with your complaining  , which is why he 's disoriented  .
thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings  .
you seasoned his food with screams  .
unquiet meals make ill digestions  .
stress during mealtime ruins the digestion  , and that gave him a raging fever  .
thereof the raging fire of fever bred  , and what 's a fever but a fit of madness  ?
fever  , as we know  , is a kind of madness  .
thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls  .
you spoiled his fun by fighting with him  , and when people ca n't enjoy themselves  , they grow moody and dull with melancholy they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed  .
sweet recreation barred  , what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy  , kinsman to grim and comfortless despair  , and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life  ?
next thing you know  , all kinds of terrible illnesses break out  .
in food  , in sport  , and life - preserving rest to be disturbed  , would mad or man or beast  .
ruining his meals  , his enjoyment  , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad  .
the consequence is  , then  , thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits  .
what i 'm saying is  , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity  .
she never reprehended him but mildly when he demeaned himself rough  , rude  , and wildly  .
she was always gentle when she scolded him  , even when he behaved in the worst and wildest ways  .
adriana why bear you these rebukes and answer not  ?
adriana why wo n't you defend yourself against this woman  ?
she did betray me to my own reproof  .
she has tricked me into seeing my own faults  .
good people  , enter and lay hold on him  .
gentlemen  , go in there and grab him  .
no  , not a creature enters in my house  .
nobody goes into my house  !
then let your servants bring my husband forth  .
then have your servants bring him out  .

i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess  .
i 'll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey  .
upon what cause  ?
why is he going there today  ?
to see a reverend syracusian merchant  , who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town  , beheaded publicly for his offense  .
to see an elderly  , unlucky merchant from syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to ephesus  .

she is a virtuous and a reverend lady  .
she 's a virtuous and holy lady  .
it can not be that she hath done thee wrong  .
she ca n't possibly have done you any wrong  .
go  , some of you  , knock at the abbey gate  , and bid the lady abbess come to me  .
go  , knock on the gate and bid the abbess come out here and speak to me  .
i will determine this before i stir  .
i 'll settle this before i go
mistress  , upon my life i tell you true  .
mistress  , i swear on my life that it 's true  .
i have not breathed almost since i did see it  .
it was just moments ago  .
he cries for you  , and vows  , if he can take you  , to scorch your face and to disfigure you  .
he 's crying out for you and swears he 'll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you  .
come  , stand by me  .
adriana stand with me  .
fear nothing  .
do n't be scared  .
guard with halberds  .
guards  , get your weapons  !
unless the fear of death doth make me dote  , i see my son antipholus and dromio  .
the fear of death might be making me senile  , but i think i see my son antipholus  , and dromio  .
this day  , great duke  , she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house  .
today  , great duke  , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores  .
a grievous fault  .
that 's terrible  !

adriana tell us  , woman  , did you do that  ?
no  , my good lord  .
no  , my good lord  .
myself  , he  , and my sister today did dine together  .
i ate with him and my sister  .
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal  .
damn my soul if these accusations are true  !
ne'er may i look on day  , nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth  .
if she 's lying  , i pray that i never sleep again at night or wake up during the day  .
my lord  , in truth  , thus far i witness with him  : that he dined not at home  , but was locked out  .
your highness  , i can confirm this much  : he was locked out of his house and did n't eat at home  .
but had he such a chain of thee or no  ?
but did he receive a necklace from you  ?
you say he dined at home  ; the goldsmith here denies that saying  .
ate at home  , but the jeweler says he did n't  .
sirrah  , what say you  ?
, what do you have to say  ?
sir  , he dined with her there  , at the porpentine  .
sir  , he ate with this woman at the porcupine  .
he did  , and from my finger snatched that ring  .
he did  , and he snatched my ring right off my finger  .
't is true  , my liege  ; this ring i had of her  .
that 's true  , my lord  : i did get this ring from her  .
saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here  ?
did you see him enter this abbey  ?
as sure  , my liege  , as i do see your grace  .
as clearly as i see you  , my lord  .
why  , this is strange  .
this is very odd  .
go call the abbess hither  .
get the abbess out here  .
i think you are all mated or stark mad  .
i think you 're all either bewildered or stark raving mad  .
most mighty duke  , vouchsafe me speak a word  .
mighty duke  , please allow me to say something  .
haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me  .
i think i see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life  .
speak freely  , syracusian  , what thou wilt  .
feel free to say what you wish  , syracusian  .
antipholus of ephesus is not your name  , sir  , called antipholus  ?
antipholus of ephesus is n't your name antipholus  ?
and is not that your bondman dromio  ?
and is n't that dromio  , the man bound to you  ?
within this hour i was his bondman sir  , but he  , i thank him  , gnawed in two my cords  .
i was bound to him an hour ago  , sir  , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes  .
now am i dromio  , and his man  , unbound  .

hello  , barnardo  .
a piece of him  .
more or less  .
welcome  , horatio  .
welcome  , horatio  .
welcome  , good marcellus  .
welcome  , marcellus  .
what  , has this thing appeared again tonight  ?
so  , tell us  , did you see that thing again tonight  ?
i have seen nothing  .
i have n't seen anything  .
horatio says 't is but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us  .
horatio says we 're imagining it  , and wo n't let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we 've seen twice now  .
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night  , that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it  .
that 's why i 've begged him to come on our shift tonight  , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it  .
sit down a while and let us once again assail your ears  , that are so fortified against our story  , what we have two nights seen  .
sit down for a while  , and we 'll tell you again the story you do n't want to believe  , about what we 've seen two nights now  .
well  , sit we down  , and let us hear barnardo speak of this  .
well  , let 's sit down and listen to barnardo tell us  .
last night of all  , when yond same star that 's westward from the pole had made his course t ' illume that part of heaven where now it burns  , marcellus and myself  , the bell then beating one
last night  , when that star to the west of the north star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it 's shining now  , at one o'clock  , marcellus and i
peace  , break thee off  .
quiet  , shut up  !
look where it comes again  !
it 's come again  .
in the same figure like the king that 's dead  .
looking just like the dead king  .
horatio thou art a scholar  .
horatio you 're well - educated  , horatio  .
speak to it  , horatio  .
say something to it  .
most like  .
very much so  .
it harrows me with fear and wonder  .
it 's terrifying  .
it would be spoke to  .
it wants us to speak to it  .
question it  , horatio  .
ask it something  , horatio  .
what art thou that usurp'st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march  ?
what are you  , that you walk out so late at night  , looking like the dead king of denmark when he dressed for battle  ?
by heaven  , i charge thee  , speak  .
by god  , i order you to speak  .
it is offended  .
it looks like you 've offended it  .
see  , it stalks away  .
look  , it 's going away  .
how now  , horatio  ?
what 's going on  , horatio  ?
you tremble and look pale  .
you 're pale and trembling  .
is not this something more than fantasy  ?
you agree now that we 're not imagining this  , do n't you  ?
what think you on 't  ?
what do you think about it  ?
before my god  , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes  .
i swear to god  , if i had n't seen this with my own eyes i 'd never believe it  .
is it not like the king  ?
does n't it look like the king  ?
as thou art to thyself  .
yes  , as much as you look like yourself  .
such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated  .
the king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of norway  .
so frowned he once when  , in an angry parle  , he smote the sledded polacks on the ice  .
and the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the poles  , traveling on the ice in sleds  .
't is strange  .
it 's weird  .
in what particular thought to work i know not  , but in the gross and scope of mine opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state  .
i do n't know exactly how to explain this  , but i have a general feeling this means bad news for our country  .
but soft  , behold  !
wait  , look  !
lo  , where it comes again  .
it has come again  .
i 'll cross it though it blast me  .
i 'll meet it if it 's the last thing i do  .
stay  , illusion  !
stay here  , you hallucination  !
if thou hast any sound or use of voice  , speak to me  .
if you have a voice or can make sounds  , speak to me  .
if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me  , speak to me  .
if there 's any good deed i can do that will bring you peace and me honor  , speak to me  .
if thou art privy to thy country 's fate  , which happily foreknowing may avoid  , oh  , speak  !
if you have some secret knowledge of your country 's sad fate which might be avoided if we knew about it then  , please  , speak  .
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth  , for which  , they say  , you spirits oft walk in death  , speak of it  .
or if you 've got some buried treasure somewhere  , which they say often makes ghosts restless  , then tell us about it  .
stay and speak  !
stay and speak  !
stop it  , marcellus  .
keep it from leaving  , marcellus  .
shall i strike at it with my partisan  ?
should i strike it with my spear  ?
do  , if it will not stand  .
yes  , if it does n't stand still  .
't is here  .
it 's over here  .
't is here  .
there it is  .
it was about to speak when the cock crew  .
it was about to say something when the rooster crowed  .
though yet of hamlet our dear brother 's death the memory be green  , and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe  , yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves  .
although i still have fresh memories of my brother the elder hamlet 's death  , and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom  , life still goes on i think it 's wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being  .
therefore our sometime sister  , now our queen  , th ' imperial jointress to this warlike state  , have we as 'twere with a defeated joy  , with an auspicious and a dropping eye  , with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage  , in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife  .
therefore  , i 've married my former sister - in - law  , the queen  , with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness  .
nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms  , which have freely gone with this affair along  .
i know that in marrying gertrude i 'm only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along for which i thank you  .
for all  , our thanks  .
now  , down to business  .
now follows that you know  .
you all know what 's happening  .
young fortinbras  , holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother 's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame  , colleagud with the dream of his advantage  , he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father  , with all bonds of law  , to our most valiant brother  .
young fortinbras  , underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil  , dreams of getting the better of me  , and never stops pestering me with demands that i surrender the territory his father lost to the elder hamlet  , my dead brother - in - law  .
so much for him  .
so much for fortinbras  .
now for ourself and for this time of meeting
now  , here 's what needs to be done  .
in that and all things will we show our duty  .
we 'll do our duty to you in that and everything else  .
we doubt it nothing  .
i have no doubt you will  .
heartily farewell  .
good - bye  .
and now  , laertes  , what 's the news with you  ?
and now  , laertes  , what do you have to tell me  ?
you told us of some suit  .
you have a favor you to ask of me  .
what is 't  , laertes  ?
what is it  , laertes  ?
you can not speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice  .
you 'll never waste your words when talking to the king of denmark  .
what wouldst thou beg  , laertes  , that shall not be my offer  , not thy asking  ?
what could you ever ask for that i would n't give you  ?
the head is not more native to the heart  , the hand more instrumental to the mouth  , than is the throne of denmark to thy father  .
your father and the danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart  , or the hand and the mouth  .
what wouldst thou have  , laertes  ?
what would you like  , laertes  ?
have you your father 's leave  ?
do you have your father 's permission  ?
what says polonius  ?
what does polonius say  ?
take thy fair hour  , laertes  .
in that case  , leave when you like  , laertes  , and spend your time however you wish  .
time be thine  , and thy best graces spend it at thy will  .
i hereby grant your request  , and hope you have a good time  .
but now  , my cousin hamlet  , and my son
and now  , hamlet  , my nephew and my son
a little more than kin and less than kind  .
too many family ties there for me  .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you  ?
why are you still so gloomy  , with a cloud hanging over you  ?
not so  , my lord  .
it 's not true  , sir  .
i am too much i ' the sun  .
your son is out in the sun  .
ay  , madam  , it is common  .
yes  , mother  , it happens all the time  .
if it be  , why seems it so particular with thee  ?
so why does it seem so particular to you  ?
and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you  .
because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne  , and i love you just as much as any father loves his son  .
for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg  , it is most retrograde to our desire  .
and your plans for going back to wittenberg are not what i want  .
and we beseech you  , bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye  , our chiefest courtier  , cousin  , and our son  .
i 'm asking you now to stay here in my company as the number - one member of my court  , my nephew and now my son too  .
i shall in all my best obey you  , madam  .
i 'll obey you as well as i can  , ma'am  .
hail to your lordship  .
hello  , sir  .
my good lord  .
hello  , sir  .
marcellus i am very glad to see you  .
marcellus so nice to see you  .
barnardo good even  , sir  .
barnardo hello  , sir  .
horatio but what  , in faith  , make you from wittenberg  ?
horatio but what are you doing away from wittenberg  , horatio  ?
a truant disposition  , good my lord  .
i felt like skipping school  , sir  .
i would not hear your enemy say so  , nor shall you do mine ear that violence  , to make it truster of your own report against yourself  .
i would n't allow your enemies to say that  , and i wo n't believe it from you  .
i know you are no truant  .
i know you 'd never skip school  .
but what is your affair in elsinore  ?
what are you doing here in elsinore  ?
we 'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart  .
i 'll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave  .
my lord  , i came to see your father 's funeral  .
sir  , we came to see your father 's funeral  .
i pray thee  , do not mock me  , fellow student  .
please  , do n't make fun of me  .
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding  .
i think you came to see my mother 's wedding instead  .
indeed  , my lord  , it followed hard upon  .
well  , sir  , it 's true it came soon after  .
thrift  , thrift  , horatio  !
it was all about saving a few bucks  , horatio  .
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables  .
the leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet  .
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day  , horatio  .
oh  , i 'd rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven  , horatio  , than have lived through that terrible day  !
my father methinks i see my father  .
my father i think i see my father  .
where  , my lord  ?
where  , sir  ?
in my mind 's eye  , horatio  .
in my imagination  , horatio  .
i saw him once  .
i saw him once  .
he was a goodly king  .
he was an admirable king  .
he was a man  .
he was a great human being  .
take him for all in all  .
he was perfect in everything  .
i shall not look upon his like again  .
i 'll never see the likes of him again  .
my lord  , i think i saw him yesternight  .
sir  , i think i saw him last night  .
saw who  ?
saw who  ?
the king my father  ?
the king my father  ?
!
!
for god 's love  , let me hear  .
for god 's sake  , let me hear it  .
but where was this  ?
but where did this happen  ?
my lord  , upon the platform where we watch  .
on the platform where we stand guard  , sir  .
did you not speak to it  ?
did n't you talk to it  ?
't is very strange  .
that 's very strange  .
as i do live  , my honored lord  , 't is true  .
i swear to god it 's true  , sir  .
and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it  .
we thought you ought to know about it  .
indeed  , indeed  , sirs  , but this troubles me  .
yes  , i should know  , but it disturbs me  .
hold you the watch tonight  ?
are you on duty again tonight  ?
we do  , my lord  .
yes  , sir  .
armed  , say you  ?
it was armed  , you say  ?
armed  , my lord  .
armed  , sir  .
from top to toe  ?
from head to toe  ?
my lord  , from head to foot  .
yes  , from top to bottom  , sir  .
then saw you not his face  ?
so you could n't see his face  , then  ?
oh yes  , my lord  .
oh  , yes  , we could  , sir  .
he wore his beaver up  .
he had his helmet visor up  .
what  , looked he frowningly  ?
was he frowning  ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger  .
he looked more sad than angry  .
pale or red  ?
was he pale or flushed and red - faced  ?
nay  , very pale  .
very pale  , sir  .
and fixed his eyes upon you  ?
did he stare at you  ?
most constantly  .
the whole time  .
i would i had been there  .
i wish i 'd been there  .
it would have much amazed you  .
you would have been very shocked  .
very like  .
i 'm sure i would have  .
stayed it long  ?
did it stay a long time  ?
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred  .
about as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred  .
longer  , longer  .
no  , longer than that  .
not when i saw 't  .
not the time i saw it  .
his beard was grizzled  , no  ?
his beard was gray  , right  ?
it was  , as i have seen it in his life  , a sable silvered  .
it was just like in real life  , dark brown with silver whiskers in it  .
i will watch tonight  .
i 'll stand guard with you tonight  .
perchance 'twill walk again  .
maybe it 'll come again  .
i warrant it will  .
i bet it will  .
if it assume my noble father 's person  , i 'll speak to it  , though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace  .
if it looks like my good father  , i 'll speak to it  , even if hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet  .
i pray you all  , if you have hitherto concealed this sight  , let it be tenable in your silence still  .
i ask you  , if you 've kept this a secret  , keep doing so  .
and whatsoever else shall hap tonight  , give it an understanding  , but no tongue  .
whatever happens tonight  , do n't talk about it  .
i will requite your loves  .
i 'll return the favor  .
so fare you well  .
so good - bye for now  .
upon the platform  , 'twixt eleven and twelve  , i 'll visit you  .
i 'll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight  .
our duty to your honor  .
we 'll do our duty to you  , sir  .
your loves  , as mine to you  .
give me your love instead  , as i give you mine  .
farewell  .
good - bye  .
my father 's spirit in arms  .
my father 's ghost armed  !
all is not well  .
something 's wrong  .
i doubt some foul play  .
i suspect some foul play  .
would the night were come  !
i wish the night were here already  !
till then sit still  , my soul  .
until then  , i have to remain calm  .
foul deeds will rise  , though all the earth o'erwhelm them  , to men 's eyes  .
bad deeds will be revealed  , no matter how people try to hide them  .
my necessaries are embarked  .
my belongings are on the ship already  .
farewell  .
good - bye  .
and  , sister  , as the winds give benefit and convey is assistant  , do not sleep  , but let me hear from you  .
and  , my dear sister  , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing  , let me hear from you write  .
do you doubt that  ?
do you doubt i 'll write  ?
no more but so  ?
no more than a minute  ?
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed  , which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal  .
so if he says he loves you  , you should be wise enough to see that his words only mean as much as the state of denmark allows them to mean  .
then weigh what loss your honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs  , or lose your heart  , or your chaste treasure open to his unmastered importunity  .
then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands  .
fear it  , ophelia  .
watch out  , ophelia  .
fear it  , my dear sister  , and keep you in the rear of your affection  , out of the shot and danger of desire  .
just keep your love under control  , and do n't let yourself become a target of his lust  .
the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon  .
simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky enough you do n't have to expose yourself to him  .
virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes  .
even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation  .
the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed  .
worms ruin flowers before they blossom  .
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth  , contagious blastments are most imminent  .
baby blooms are most susceptible to disease  .
be wary  , then  .
so be careful  .
best safety lies in fear  .
fear will keep you safe  .
youth to itself rebels  , though none else near  .
young people often lose their self - control even without any help from others  .
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart  .
i 'll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart  .
but  , good my brother  , do not  , as some ungracious pastors do  , show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles  , like a puffed and reckless libertine  , himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede  .
but  , my dear brother  , do n't be like a bad priest who fails to practice what he preaches  , showing me the steep and narrow way to heaven while you frolic on the primrose path of sin  .
o  , fear me not  .
do n't worry  , i wo n't  .
most humbly do i take my leave  , my lord  .
i humbly say good - bye to you  , father  .
't is in my memory locked  , and you yourself shall keep the key of it  .
it 's locked away in my memory  , and you 've got the key  .
farewell  .
good - bye  .
what is 't  , ophelia  , he hath said to you  ?
what did he tell you  , ophelia  ?
so please you  , something touching the lord hamlet  .
something about hamlet  .
marry  , well bethought  .
a good thing he did  , by god  .
't is told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you  , and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous  .
i 've heard hamlet 's been spending a lot of time alone with you recently  , and you 've made yourself quite available to him  .
if it be so as so 't is put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you  , you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behooves my daughter and your honor  .
if things are the way people tell me they are and they 're only telling me this to warn me then i have to say  , you 're not conducting yourself with the self - restraint a daughter of mine should show  .
what is between you  ?
what 's going on between you two  ?
give me up the truth  .
tell me the truth  .
he hath  , my lord  , of late made many tenders of his affection to me  .
he 's offered me a lot of affection lately  .
i do not know  , my lord  , what i should think  .
i do n't know what to believe  , father  .
marry  , i 'll teach you  .
then i 'll tell you  .
think yourself a baby that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay  , which are not sterling  .
believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these offers are something real  .
tender yourself more dearly  , or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase  , running it thus you 'll tender me a fool  .
offer yourself more respect  , or not to beat this word to death you 'll offer me the chance to be a laughing - stock  .
my lord  , he hath importuned me with love in honorable fashion  .
father  , he 's always talked about love in an honorable fashion
ay  , fashion you may call it  .
yes  , fashion is just the word a passing whim  .
go to  , go to  .
go on  .
and hath given countenance to his speech  , my lord  , with almost all the holy vows of heaven  .
and he 's made the holiest vows to me  , to back up what he says  .
i shall obey  , my lord  .
i 'll do as you say  , father  .
it is a nipping and an eager air  .
yes  , it 's definitely nippy  .
what hour now  ?
what time is it  ?
i think it lacks of twelve  .
a little before twelve  , i think  .
no  , it is struck  .
no  , it 's just after twelve  ; i heard the clock strike  .
indeed  ?
really  ?
i heard it not  .
i did n't hear it  .
it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk  .
so it 's nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear  .
what does this mean  , my lord  ?
what does that mean  , sir  ?
is it a custom  ?
is that a tradition  ?
ay  , marry  , is 't  .
yes  , it is  .
but to my mind  , though i am native here and to the manner born  , it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance  .
but though i was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage  , i think it would be better to ignore it than practice it  .
this heavy - headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations  .
other countries criticize us for our loud partying  .
look  , my lord  , it comes  !
look  , sir here it comes  !
angels and ministers of grace defend us  !
oh angels  , protect us  !
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned  , bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell  , be thy intents wicked or charitable  , thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee  .
whether you 're a good spirit or a cursed demon  , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire  , whether your intentions are good or evil  , you look so strange i want to talk to you  .
i 'll call thee hamlet  , king  , father  , royal dane  .
i 'll call you hamlet senior  , king  , father  , royal dane  .
o  , answer me  !
answer me  !
let me not burst in ignorance  , but tell why thy canonized bones  , hearsed in death  , have burst their cerements  ; why the sepulcher  ,
do n't drive me crazy with curiosity  , but tell me why your church - buried bones have burst out of their coffin  , and why your tomb  ,
wherein we saw thee quietly interred  , hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again  .
where we quietly buried you  , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again  .
what may this mean  , that thou  , dead corse  , again in complete steel revisits thus the glimpses of the moon  , making night hideous and we fools of nature  , so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls  ?
what could it mean that you have put on your armor again  , you corpse  , and have come back to look at the moon  , making the night terrifying and stirring us humans with supernatural fears  ?
say why is this  ?
why  ?
wherefore  ?
what do you want from us  ?
what should we do  ?
what should we do  ?
it beckons you to go away with it  , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone  .
it wants you to go off with it  , as if it wants to tell you something alone  .
look  , with what courteous action it waves you to a more removd ground  .
look how politely it 's pointing you to a place that 's farther away  .
but do not go with it  .
but do n't go  .
no  , by no means  .
definitely not  .
do not  , my lord  .
do n't do it  , sir  .
you shall not go  , my lord  .
you 're not going  , sir  .
hold off your hands  .
let go of me  .
be ruled  .
calm down  .
you shall not go  .
you 're not going anywhere  .
my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion 's nerve  .
it 's my fate calling me  .
still am i called  .
every nerve in my body is now as tough as steel  .
unhand me  , gentlemen  .
the ghost is still waving me over  .
by heaven  , i 'll make a ghost of him that lets me  .
let me go  , gentlemen  .
i say  , away  !
i swear  , if anyone holds me back  , i 'll make a ghost of him  !
go on  .
i say  , get away  !
i 'll follow thee  .
go ahead  , i 'll follow you  .
he waxes desperate with imagination  .
his imagination is making him crazy  .
let 's follow  .
let 's follow them  .
't is not fit thus to obey him  .
it 's not right to obey his orders to let him go alone  .
have after  .
go ahead and follow him  .
to what issue will this come  ?
but what does all this mean  , where will it all end  ?
something is rotten in the state of denmark  .
it means that something is rotten in the state of denmark  .
heaven will direct it  .
if that 's true  , we should let god take care of it  .
nay  , let 's follow him  .
no  , let 's follow him  .
mark me  .
listen to me  .
i will  .
i will  .
my hour is almost come when i to sulfurous and tormenting flames must render up myself  .
the hour has almost come when i have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory  .
alas  , poor ghost  !
ah  , poor ghost  !
speak  .
speak  .
i am bound to hear  .
i 'm ready to hear you  .
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear  .
you must be ready for revenge  , too  , when you hear me out  .
what  ?
what  ?
i am thy father 's spirit  , doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires  , till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away  .
i 'm the ghost of your father  , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night  , while during the day i 'm trapped in the fires of purgatory until i 've done penance for my past sins  .
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house  , i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul  , freeze thy young blood  ,
if i were n't forbidden to tell you the secrets of  , i could tell you stories that would slice through your soul  , freeze your blood  ,
make thy two eyes  , like stars  , start from their spheres  , thy knotted and combind locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end  , like quills upon the fearful porpentine  .
make your eyes jump out of their sockets  , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills  .
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood  .
but mortals like you are n't allowed to hear this description of the afterlife  .
list  , list  , o  , list  !
listen  , listen  !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love
if you ever loved your poor dear father
o god  !
oh god  !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder  .
take revenge for his horrible murder  , that crime against nature  .
murder  ?
murder  ?
murder most foul  , as in the best it is  .
his most horrible murder  .
but this most foul  , strange and unnatural  .
murder 's always horrible  , but this one was especially horrible  , weird  , and unnatural  .
haste me to know 't  , that i  , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love  , may sweep to my revenge  .
hurry and tell me about it  , so i can take revenge right away  , faster than a person falls in love  .
o my prophetic soul  !
i knew it  !
my uncle  ?
my uncle  ?
ay  , that incestuous  , that adulterate beast  , with witchcraft of his wit  , with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts  , that have the power so to seduce  !
yes  , that incestuous  , adulterous animal  .
won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming - virtuous queen  .
with his clever words and fancy gifts  , he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen  , persuading her to give in to his lust  .
o hamlet  , what a falling off was there  !
they were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that  !
from me  , whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage  , and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine  .
oh  , hamlet  , how far she fell  !
but virtue  , as it never will be moved  , though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven  , so lust  , though to a radiant angel linked  , will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage  .
she went from me  , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage  , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine  .
but soft  !
but just as you ca n't corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try  , the opposite is also true  : a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage  .
methinks i scent the morning air  .
but hang on  , i think i smell the morning air  .
brief let me be  .
so let me be brief here  .
sleeping within my orchard  , my custom always of the afternoon  , upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial  , and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment  , whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigor doth posset and curd  , like eager droppings into milk  , the thin and wholesome blood  .
your uncle snuck up to me while i was sleeping in the orchard  , as i always used to do in the afternoon  , and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood  , which is just what it did to me  .
so did it mine  .
i broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust  .
and a most instant tetter barked about  , most lazar - like  , with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body  .
and that 's how my brother robbed me of my life  , my crown  , and my queen all at once  .
thus was i  , sleeping  , by a brother 's hand of life  , of crown  , of queen at once dispatched  , cut off even in the blossoms of my sin  ,
he cut me off in the middle of a sinful life  .
o all you host of heaven  !
ah  , all you up in heaven  !
o earth  !
and earth  !
what else  ?
what else  ?
and shall i couple hell  ?
shall i include hell as well  ?
oh  , fie  !
damn it  !
hold  , hold  , my heart  , and you  , my sinews  , grow not instant old  , but bear me stiffly up  .
keep beating  , my heart  , and muscles  , do n't grow old yet keep me standing  .
remember thee  !
remember you  !
ay  , thou poor ghost  , whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe  .
yes  , you poor ghost  , as long as i have any power of memory in this distracted head  .
remember thee  !
remember you  !
yea  , from the table of my memory i 'll wipe away all trivial fond records  , all saws of books  , all forms  , all pressures past that youth and observation copied there  , and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain  , unmixed with baser matter  .
yes  , i 'll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there  .
yes  , by heaven  !
yes  , by god  !
o most pernicious woman  !
oh  , you evil woman  !
o villain  , villain  , smiling  , damnd villain  !
oh  , you villain  , villain  , you damned  , smiling villain  !
my tables  !
where 's my notebook  ?
meet it is i set it down that one may smile  , and smile  , and be a villain  .
it 's a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile  , and be a villain  .
at least i 'm sure it may be so in denmark  .
at least it 's possible in denmark  .
so  , uncle  , there you are  .
so  , uncle  , there you are  .
now to my word  .
now it 's time to deal with the vow i made to my father  .
my lord  , my lord  !
sir  , sir  !
lord hamlet
lord hamlet  .
heaven secure him  !
please let him be all right  !
so be it  .
i 'm all right  .
illo  , ho  , ho  , my lord  !
oh - ho - ho  , sir  !
hillo  , ho  , ho  , boy  .
oh - ho - ho  , kid  !
come  , bird  , come  .
come here  .
how is 't  , my noble lord  ?
so how did it go  , sir  ?
what news  , my lord  ?
what happened  , sir  ?
oh  , wonderful  !
it was incredible  !
good my lord  , tell it  .
oh  , please  , tell us  , sir  .
not i  , my lord  , by heaven  .
i swear i wo n't  , sir  .
nor i  , my lord  .
i wo n't either  , sir  .
ay  , by heaven  , my lord  .
yes  , i swear  .
there 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he 's an arrant knave  .
any villain in denmark is going to be  , well  , a villain  .
there needs no ghost  , my lord  , come from the grave to tell us this  .
you do n't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that  , sir  .
why  , right  , you are in the right  .
yes  , you 're absolutely right  .
and so  , without more circumstance at all  , i hold it fit that we shake hands and part  .
so  , without further ado  , the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways  .
you  , as your business and desire shall point you for every man has business and desire  , such as it is and for my own poor part  , look you  , i 'll go pray  .
you go and take care of your business  ( since everybody has some business to take care of  , whatever it is worth  )  , and i 'll go and pray  .
these are but wild and whirling words  , my lord  .
you 're talking in such a crazy way  , sir  .
yes  , by saint patrick  , but there is  , horatio  , and much offense too  .
ah  , but there is  , horatio  , there 's a lot of offense  .
touching this vision here  , it is an honest ghost  , that let me tell you  .
as for this ghost we just saw  , he 's a real one  , i can tell you that much  .
for your desire to know what is between us  , o'ermaster 't as you may  .
but regarding what happened between us  , do n't ask i ca n't tell you  .
and now  , good friends  , as you are friends  , scholars and soldiers  , give me one poor request  .
and now  , my friends  , my courageous and educated friends  , do me one small favor  .
what is 't  , my lord  ?
what is it  , sir  ?
we will  .
of course we will  .
never make known what you have seen tonight  .
do n't ever tell anyone what you 've seen tonight  .
my lord  , we will not  .
we wo n't  , sir  .
nay  , but swear 't  .
no  , you have to swear it  .
in faith  , my lord  , not i  .
i swear to god i wo n't  .
nor i  , my lord  , in faith  .
me too  , i wo n't  , i swear to god  .
upon my sword  .
swear by my sword  .
we have sworn  , my lord  , already  .
but we already swore  , sir  .
indeed  , upon my sword  , indeed  .
yes  , but swear by my sword this time  .
swear  !
swear  !
propose the oath  , my lord  .
tell us what to swear  , sir  .
never to speak of this that you have seen  .
you swear never to mention what you 've seen  .
swear by my sword  .
swear by my sword  .
swear  .
swear  .
 ?
you 're everywhere  , are n't you  ?
then we 'll shift our ground  .
maybe we should move  .
come hither  , gentlemen  , and lay your hands again upon my sword  .
come over here  , gentlemen  , and put your hands on my sword again  .
swear by my sword never to speak of this that you have heard  .
swear by my sword you 'll never mention what you 've heard  .
swear by his sword  .
swear by his sword  .
well said  , old mole  !
you said it right  , old mole  .
canst work i ' th ' earth so fast  ?
you 're pretty busy down there in the dirt  , are n't you  ?
a worthy pioneer  !
what a tunneler  !
once more remove  , good friends  .
let 's move again  , my friends  .
o day and night  , but this is wondrous strange  !
my god  , this is unbelievably strange  .
swear  !
swear  .
give him this money and these notes  , reynaldo  .
give him this money and these letters  , reynaldo  .
i will  , my lord  .
i will  , sir  .
you shall do marvelous wisely  , good reynaldo  , before you visit him  , to make inquire of his behavior  .
it would be wonderfully wise of you  , my dear reynaldo  , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him  .
my lord  , i did intend it  .
that 's what i thought too  , sir  .
ay  , very well  , my lord  .
yes  , very well  , sir  .
as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty  .
sound like your average young guy  , the kind of trouble they get into  .
as gaming  , my lord  ?
like gambling  , sir  ?
ay  , or drinking  , fencing  , swearing  , quarreling  , drabbing you may go so far  .
that 's right  , or drinking  , swearing  , fist - fighting  , visiting prostitutes that kind of thing  .
my lord  , that would dishonor him  !
but that would ruin his reputation  !
but  , my good lord
but  , sir
wherefore should you do this  ?
why should you do this  , you want to know  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , sir  .
i would know that  .
i 'd like to know  .
very good  , my lord  .
yes  , sir  .
and then  , sir  , does he this  , he does what was i about to say  ?
and then he 'll he 'll wait  , what was i about to say  ?
by the mass  , i was about to say something  .
good god  , i was about to say something  .
where did i leave  ?
what was i saying  ?
at closes in the consequence  , at friend  , ' or so and gentleman  . '
at  , it will be natural for him to agree with you he 'll call you sir  , ' friend  , ' et cetera  .
at closes in the consequence  .
it will be natural for him to agree with you  .
ay  , marry  .
ah  , yes  , that 's right  .
he closes thus  : i know the gentleman  .
if he agrees he 'll say something like this  : yes  , i know the gentleman you 're referring to  .
i saw him yesterday or t ' other day  , or then  , or then  , with such or such and  , as you say  , there was he gaming  , there o'ertook in 's rouse  , there falling out at tennis  , or  , perchance  , i saw him enter such a house of sale a brothel  , or so forth  .
i just saw him yesterday  , or the other day  , or whenever it is  , you know  , and there he was gambling  , or there he was  , totally wasted  , or fighting with somebody about a tennis match  , or going into a house of ill repute that means a whorehouse  , you know or whatever  .
see you now  , your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth  .
make sure your little lie brings out the truth  .
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach  , with windlasses and with assays of bias  , by indirections find directions out  .
we 're doing this wisely and intelligently  , indirectly  , finding out things by roundabout means  .
so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son  .
that 's how you 'll find out what my son is up to in paris  .
you have me  , have you not  ?
you get my point  , do n't you  ?
my lord  , i have  .
yes  , i do  , sir  .
god be wi ' you  .
god bless you  .
fare you well  .
have a safe trip  .
good my lord  .
thank you  , sir  .
i shall  , my lord  .
i will  , sir  .
and let him ply his music  .
and i hope he 's studying his music like he 's supposed to  .
well  , my lord  .
got it  , sir  .
farewell  .
good - bye  .
o my lord  , my lord  , i have been so affrighted  !
oh  , father  , father  , i 've just had such a scare  !
with what  , i ' th ' name of god  ?
from what  , in god 's name  ?
mad for thy love  ?
is he crazy with love for you  ?
what said he  ?
what did he say  ?
both your majesties might  , by the sovereign power you have of us  , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty  .
both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command  , instead of asking us so politely  .
thanks  , rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern  .
thanks  , rosencrantz and worthy guildenstern  .
thanks  , guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz  .
thanks  , guildenstern and worthy rosencrantz  .
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changd son  .
i beg you to pay a visit right away to my son  , who 's changed too much  .
go  , some of you  , and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is  .
servants  , take these gentlemen to see hamlet  .
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him  !
i hope to god we can make him happy and do him some good  !
ay  , amen  !
amen to that  !
th ' ambassadors from norway  , my good lord  , are joyfully returned  .
the ambassadors are back from norway  , sir  .
thou still hast been the father of good news  .
once again you bring good news  .
have i  , my lord  ?
do i  , sir  ?
i assure my good liege  , i hold my duty as i hold my soul  , both to my god and to my gracious king  .
i assure your majesty i 'm only doing my duty both to my god and my good king  .
and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet 's lunacy  .
and i believe unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be that i 've found out why hamlet 's gone crazy  .
oh  , speak of that  .
tell me  !
that do i long to hear  .
i want very much to find out  .
give first admittance to th ' ambassadors  .
all right  , but first let the ambassadors speak  .
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast  .
then you can hear my news  , as dessert  .
thyself do grace to them  , and bring them in  .
then be so kind as to show them in  .
he tells me  , my dear gertrude  , he hath found the head and source of all your son 's distemper  .
gertrude  , he says he 's found out the reason for your son 's insanity  .
i doubt it is no other but the main  : his father 's death and our o'erhasty marriage  .
i doubt it 's anything but the obvious reason  : his father 's dying and our quick marriage  .
well  , we shall sift him  .
well  , we 'll get to the bottom of it  .
welcome  , my good friends  !
welcome  , my good friends  .
say  , voltemand  , what from our brother norway  ?
tell me  , voltemand  , what 's the news from the king of norway  ?
most fair return of greetings and desires  .
greetings to you too  , your highness  .
upon our first  , he sent out to suppress his nephew 's levies  , which to him appeared to be a preparation 'gainst the polack  , but  , better looked into  , he truly found it was against your highness  .
as soon as we raised the matter  , the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew 's war preparations  , which he originally thought were directed against poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you  .
whereat grieved that so his sickness  , age  , and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras  , which he  , in brief  , obeys  , receives rebuke from norway  , and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th ' assay of arms against your majesty  .
he was very upset that fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him  , and he ordered fortinbras 's arrest  .
whereon old norway  , overcome with joy  ,
fortinbras swore never to threaten denmark again  .
it likes us well  , and at our more considered time we 'll read  , answer  , and think upon this business  .
i like this news  , and when i have time i 'll read this and think about how to reply  .
meantime we thank you for your well - took labor  .
meanwhile  , thank you for your efforts  .
go to your rest  .
go relax now  .
at night we 'll feast together  .
tonight we 'll have dinner  .
most welcome home  !
welcome back  !
more matter  , with less art  .
please  , stick to the point  .
came this from hamlet to her  ?
hamlet wrote this letter to ophelia  ?
but how hath she received his love  ?
and how did she react to all this  ?
what do you think of me  ?
sir  , what is your opinion of me  ?
as of a man faithful and honorable  .
i know you are loyal and honorable  .
gertrude do you think 't is this  ?
gertrude do you think that 's why hamlet 's crazy  ?
it may be  , very like  .
it may be  , it certainly may be  .
hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said  , 't is so  , when it proved otherwise  ?
has there ever been a time i 'd really like to know when i 've definitely said something was true  , and it turned out not to be true  ?
not that i know  .
not that i know of  .
take this from this if this be otherwise  .
chop my head off if i 'm wrong  .
if circumstances lead me  , i will find where truth is hid  , though it were hid indeed within the center  .
i 'll follow the clues and uncover the truth  , even if it 's at the very center of the earth  .
how may we try it further  ?
what can we do to find out if it 's true  ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby  .
well  , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time  .
so he does indeed  .
yes  , he does  .
at such a time i 'll loose my daughter to him  .
when he 's there next time  , i 'll send my daughter to see him  .
claudius be you and i behind an arras then  , mark the encounter  .
( to claudius  ) you and i will hide behind the and watch what happens  .
if he love her not and be not from his reason fall'n thereon  , let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters  .
if it turns out that hamlet 's not in love after all  , and has n't gone mad from love  , then you can fire me from my court job and i 'll go work on a farm  .
we will try it  .
we 'll try what you suggest  .
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading  .
look how sadly he 's coming in  , reading his book  .
away  , i do beseech you  , both away  .
please go away  , both of you  .
i 'll board him presently  .
i 'll speak to him now  .
o  , give me leave  .
oh  , please let me  .
how does my good lord hamlet  ?
how are you  , hamlet  ?
well  , god - 'a' - mercy  .
fine  , thank you  .
do you know me  , my lord  ?
do you know who i am  ?
excellent well  .
of course  .
you are a fishmonger  .
you sell fish  .
not i  , my lord  .
no  , not me  , sir  .
then i would you were so honest a man  .
in that case i wish you were as good a man as a fish seller  .
honest  , my lord  ?
good  , sir  ?
ay  , sir  .
yes  , sir  .
to be honest  , as this world goes  , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand  .
only one man in ten thousand is good in this world  .
that 's very true  , my lord  .
that 's definitely true  , my lord  .
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog  , being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter  ?
since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog  , kissing the corpse by the way  , do you have a daughter  ?
i have  , my lord  .
i do indeed  , my lord  .
let her not walk i ' th ' sun  .
then by all means never let her walk in public  .
conception is a blessing  , but  , as your daughter may conceive friend  , look to 't  .
procreation is a good thing  , but if your daughter gets pregnant look out  , friend  .
how say you by that  ?
now  , what does he mean by that  ?
still harping on my daughter  .
still harping on my daughter  .
yet he knew me not at first  .
but he did n't recognize me at first  .
he said i was a fishmonger  .
he mistook me for a fish seller  .
he is far gone  , far gone  .
he 's far gone  .
and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love  , very near this  .
but when i was young i went crazy for love too  , almost as bad as this  .
i 'll speak to him again  .
i 'll talk to him again  .
hamlet what do you read  , my lord  ?
hamlet what are you reading  , your highness  ?
words  , words  , words  .
a lot of words  .
what is the matter  , my lord  ?
and what is the subject  ?
between who  ?
between whom  ?
i mean  , the matter that you read  , my lord  .
i mean  , what do the words say  ?
though this be madness  , yet there is method in 't  .
there 's a method to his madness  .
hamlet will you walk out of the air  , my lord  ?
hamlet will you step outside  , my lord  ?
into my grave  .
into my grave  .
indeed  , that is out of the air  .
well  , that 's certainly out of this world  , all right  .
how pregnant sometimes his replies are  .
his answers are so full of meaning sometimes  !
a happiness that often madness hits on  , which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of  .
he has a way with words  , as crazy people often do  , and that sane people do n't have a talent for  .
i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter  .
i 'll leave him now and arrange a meeting between him and my daughter  .
hamlet my honorable lord  , i will most humbly take my leave of you  .
hamlet my lord  , i 'll of you now  .
you can not  , sir  , take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life  , except my life  , except my life  .
you ca n't take anything from me that i care less about except my life  , except my life  , except my life  .
fare you well  , my lord  .
good - bye  , my lord  .
these tedious old fools  !
these boring old fools  !
you go to seek the lord hamlet  .
you 're looking for lord hamlet  .
there he is  .
he 's right over there  .
god save you  , sir  !
thank you  , sir  .
my honored lord  !
my lord  !
my most dear lord  !
my dear sir  !
my excellent good friends  !
ah  , my good old friends  !
how dost thou  , guildenstern  ?
how are you  , guildenstern  ?
ah  , rosencrantz  !
and rosencrantz  !
good lads  , how do you both  ?
boys  , how are you both doing  ?
as the indifferent children of the earth  .
oh  , as well as anybody  .
happy  , in that we are not overhappy  .
happy that we 're not too happy  , lucky in being not too lucky  .
on fortune 's cap we are not the very button  .
we 're not exactly at the top of our luck  .
nor the soles of her shoes  ?
but you 're not down and out  , either  , are you  ?
neither  , my lord  .
no  , we 're just somewhere in the middle  , my lord  .
then you live about her waist  , or in the middle of her favors  ?
so you 're around lady luck 's waist  ?
faith  , her privates we  .
yes  , we 're the privates in her army  .
then is doomsday near  .
in that case  , the end of the world is approaching  .
but your news is not true  .
but you 're wrong  .
let me question more in particular  .
let me ask you a particular question  .
what have you  , my good friends  , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither  ?
what crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison  ?
prison  , my lord  ?
prison  , my lord  ?
denmark 's a prison  .
denmark 's a prison  .
then is the world one  .
then i guess the whole world is one  .
a goodly one  , in which there are many confines  , wards  , and dungeons  , denmark being one o ' th ' worst  .
yes  , quite a large one  , with many cells and dungeons  , denmark being one of the worst  .
we think not so  , my lord  .
we do n't think so  , my lord  .
why  , then  , 't is none to you  , for there is nothing either good or bad  , but thinking makes it so  .
well  , then it is n't one to you  , since nothing is really good or bad in itself it 's all what a person thinks about it  .
to me it is a prison  .
and to me  , denmark is a prison  .
why then  , your ambition makes it one  .
that must be because you 're so ambitious  .
't is too narrow for your mind  .
it 's too small for your large mind  .
which dreams indeed are ambition  , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream  .
dreams are a sign of ambition  , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream  .
a dream itself is but a shadow  .
but a dream itself is just a shadow  .
then are our beggars bodies  , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows  .
then i guess beggars are the ones with bodies  , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars  .
shall we to th ' court  ?
should we go inside  ?
for by my fay  , i can not reason  .
i seem to be losing my mind a bit  .
we 'll wait upon you  .
we 're at your service  , whatever you say  .
what should we say  , my lord  ?
what should we say  , my lord  ?
to what end  , my lord  ?
why would they do that  , my lord  ?
that you must teach me  .
that 's what i want you to tell me  .
but let me conjure you  , by the rights of our fellowship  , by the consonancy of our youth  , by the obligation of our ever - preserved love  , and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal  : be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no  .
let me remind you of our old friendship  , our youth spent together  , the duties of our love for each other  , and whatever else will make you answer me straight  .
guildenstern what say you  ?
guildenstern what do you think  ?
my lord  , we were sent for  .
my lord  , we were sent for  .
my lord  , there was no such stuff in my thoughts  .
my lord  , i was n't thinking anything like that  .
why did you laugh then  , when i said man delights not me  ?
so why did you laugh when i said that men do n't interest me  ?
to think  , my lord  , if you delight not in man  , what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you  .
i was just thinking that if people do n't interest you  , you 'll be pretty bored by the actors on their way here  .
we coted them on the way  , and hither are they coming to offer you service  .
we crossed paths with a drama company just a while ago  , and they 're coming to entertain you  .
he that plays the king shall be welcome  .
the one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome  .
his majesty shall have tribute of me  .
i 'll treat him like a real king  .
the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target  , the lover shall not sigh gratis  , the humorous man shall end his part in peace  , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o ' th ' sear  , and the lady shall say her mind freely  , or the blank verse shall halt for 't  .
the adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield  , the lover will be rewarded for his sighs  , the crazy character can rant all he wants  , the clown will make everybody laugh  , and the lady character can say whatever 's on her mind  , or i 'll stop the play  .
what players are they  ?
which troupe is it  ?
even those you were wont to take delight in  , the tragedians of the city  .
the tragic actors from the city  , the ones you used to enjoy so much  .
how chances it they travel  ?
what are they doing on the road  ?
their residence  , both in reputation and profit  , was better both ways  .
they made more money and got more attention in the city  .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation  .
but things have changed there  , and it 's easier for them on the road now  .
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city  ?
are they as popular as they used to be when i lived in the city  ?
are they so followed  ?
do they attract big audiences  ?
no  , indeed are they not  .
no  , not like before  .
how comes it  ?
why  ?
do they grow rusty  ?
are they getting rusty  ?
nay  , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace  .
no  , they 're busy and as excellent as ever  .
but there is  , sir  , an eyrie of children  , little eyases  , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't  .
the problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it  .
these are now the fashion  , and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither  .
these child actors are now in fashion  , and they 've so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all  , they 're so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys  .
faith  , there has been much to do on both sides  , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy  .
there 's been a whole debate on the topic  .
there was  , for a while  , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question  .
for a while  , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children 's playwright and the actors playing adult roles  .
is 't possible  ?
are you kidding  ?
oh  , there has been much throwing about of brains  .
oh  , there 's been a lot of quarreling  .
do the boys carry it away  ?
and the boys are winning so far  ?
it is not very strange  .
actually  , it 's not so unusual when you think about it  .
for my uncle is king of denmark  , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty  , forty  , fifty  , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little  .
my uncle is king of denmark  , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty  , forty  , fifty  , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him  .
'sblood  , there is something in this more than natural  , if philosophy could find it out  .
there 's something downright unnatural about it  , if a philosopher stopped to think about it  .
there are the players  .
the actors are here  .
gentlemen  , you are welcome to elsinore  .
gentlemen  , welcome to elsinore  .
your hands  , come then  .
do n't be shy shake hands with me  .
th ' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony  .
if i 'm going to welcome you i have to go through all these polite customs  , do n't i  ?
let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players  , which  , i tell you  , must show fairly outwards  , should more appear like entertainment than yours  .
and if we do n't shake hands  , when i act all nice to the players it will seem like i 'm happier to see them than you  .
you are welcome  .
you are very welcome here  .
but my uncle - father and aunt - mother are deceived  .
but still  , my uncle - father and aunt - mother have got the wrong idea  .
in what  , my dear lord  ?
in what sense  , my lord  ?
i am but mad north - north - west  .
i 'm only crazy sometimes  .
when the wind is southerly  , i know a hawk from a handsaw  .
at other times  , i know what 's what  .
well be with you  , gentlemen  .
gentlemen  , i hope you are well  .
hark you  , guildenstern  , and you too at each ear a hearer  .
listen  , guildenstern  , and you too  , rosencrantz listen as close as you can  !
polonius that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling - clouts
polonius this big baby is still in diapers  .
happily he 's the second time come to them  , for they say an old man is twice a child  .
yes  , the second time around  , since  , as they say  , old people become children again  .
my lord  , i have news to tell you  .
my lord  , i have news for you  .
my lord  , i have news to tell you  .
my lord  , i have news for you  .
when roscius was an actor in rome
when roscius was an actor in ancient rome
the actors are come hither  , my lord  .
the actors have arrived  , my lord  .
buzz  , buzz  .
yawn  , snore  .
upon my honor
i swear
then came each actor on his ass
each actor arrived on his ass  .
the best actors in the world  , either for tragedy  , comedy  , history  , pastoral  , pastoral - comical  , historical - pastoral  , tragical - historical  , tragical - comical - historical - pastoral  , scene individable  , or poem unlimited  .
they are the best actors in the world  , either for  .
seneca can not be too heavy  , nor plautus too light  .
the tragic playwright seneca is not too heavy for them to handle nor is the comic writer plautus too light  .
for the law of writ and the liberty  , these are the only men  .
for formal plays or freer dramas  , these are the best actors around  .
o jephthah  , judge of israel  , what a treasure hadst thou  !
oh  ,  , judge of ancient israel  , what a treasure you had  !
what a treasure had he  , my lord  ?
what treasure did he have  , my lord  ?
why  ,  ,  .
well  ,  ,  .
still on my daughter  .
still talking about my daughter  , i see  .
am i not i ' th ' right  , old jephthah  ?
are n't i right  , jephthah  , old man  ?
if you call me jephthah  , my lord  , i have a daughter that i love passing well  .
if you 're calling me jephthah  , my lord  , i do have a daughter i love more than anything  , yes  .
what follows  , then  , my lord  ?
what is logical  , then  , my lord  ?
why  ,
why  ,
and then  , you know  , the first row of the pious chanson will show you more  , for look where my abridgement comes  .
 , and then  , you know  , if you want to know more  , you can refer to the popular song  , because now i have to stop  .
you are welcome  , masters  , welcome  , all  !
welcome  , welcome to all of you  .
i am glad to see thee well  .
oh  , you  , i 'm glad to see you  .
welcome  , good friends  .
welcome  , my good friends  .
o old friend  ?
oh  , it 's you  !
why  , thy face is valenced since i saw thee last  .
you 've grown a beard since i saw you last  .
comest thou to beard me in denmark  ?
are you going to put a beard on me too  ?
what  , my young lady and mistress  !
well hello  , my young lady friend  .
by 'r lady  , your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last  , by the altitude of a chopine  .
you 've grown as much as the height of a pair of platform shoes at least  !
pray god  , your voice  , like a piece of uncurrent gold  , be not cracked within the ring  .
i hope your voice has n't changed yet  .
masters  , you are all welcome  .
all of you are most welcome here  .
we 'll e'en to 't like french falconers  , fly at any thing we see  .
we 'll get right to business  .
we 'll have a speech straight  .
first  , a speech  .
come  , give us a taste of your quality  .
come on  , give us a little speech to whet our appetites  .
come  , a passionate speech  .
a passionate speech  , please  .
what speech  , my good lord  ?
which speech  , my lord  ?
'fore god  , my lord  , well spoken  , with good accent and good discretion  .
my god  , that was well done  , my lord  , with the right accent and a good ear  .
 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  .
 ,  .
,
,
this is too long  .
this speech is going on too long  .
the mobld queen  ?
the muffled queen  ?
that 's good  .
that 's good  .
mobld queen is good  .
the muffled queen is good  .
look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in 's eyes  .
look how flushed the actor is  , with tears in his eyes  .
prithee  , no more  .
all right  , that 's enough  , please  .
first player 't is well  .
first player very fine  .
i 'll have thee speak out the rest soon  .
i 'll have you perform the rest of it soon  .
polonius good my lord  , will you see the players well bestowed  ?
polonius my lord  , will you make sure the actors are made comfortable  ?
do you hear  , let them be well used  , for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time  .
make sure you 're good to them  , since what they say about us later will go down in history  .
after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live  .
it 'd be better to have a bad epitaph on our graves than to have their ill will while we 're alive  .
my lord  , i will use them according to their desert  .
my lord  , i will give them all they deserve  .
god 's bodykins  , man  , much better  .
good heavens  , man  , give them more than that  !
use every man after his desert  , and who should 'scape whipping  ?
if you pay everyone what they deserve  , would anyone ever escape a whipping  ?
use them after your own honor and dignity  .
treat them with honor and dignity  .
the less they deserve  , the more merit is in your bounty  .
the less they deserve  , the more your generosity is worth  .
take them in  .
lead them inside  .
come  , sirs  .
come  , everyone  .
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
we 'll ha 't tomorrow night  .
then we 'll see that tomorrow night  .
you could  , for a need  , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't  , could you not  ?
by the way  , if i were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play  , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow  , right  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
very well  .
very well  .
follow that lord  , and look you mock him not  .
follow that gentleman now  , and be careful not to make fun of him  .
my good friends  , i 'll leave you till night  .
my good friends  , i 'll see you tomorrow  .
you are welcome to elsinore  .
welcome to elsinore  .
good my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion  , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy  ?
and you ca n't put your heads together and figure out why he 's acting so dazed and confused  , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy  ?
nor do we find him forward to be sounded  .
and he 's not exactly eager to be interrogated  .
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state  .
he 's very sly and dances around our questions when we try to get him to talk about how he feels  .
did he receive you well  ?
did he treat you well when you saw him  ?
most like a gentleman  .
yes  , in a very gentlemanly way  .
but with much forcing of his disposition  .
but it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us  .
niggard of question  , but of our demands most free in his reply  .
he did n't ask questions  , but answered ours at length  .
madam  , it so fell out  , that certain players we o'erraught on the way  .
madam  , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here  .
of these we told him  , and there did seem in him a kind of joy
we told hamlet about them  , and that seemed to do him good  .
't is most true  , and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter  .
it 's true  , and he asked me to beg you both to attend  .
with all my heart  , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined  .
it makes me very happy to hear he 's so interested  .
good gentlemen  , give him a further edge  , and drive his purpose on to these delights  .
gentlemen  , please try to sharpen his interest even more  , and let this play do him some good  .
we shall  , my lord  .
we will  , my lord  .
madam  , i wish it may  .
i hope so too  , madam  .
ophelia  , walk you here  .
ophelia  , come here  .
claudius gracious  , so please you  , we will bestow ourselves  .
claudius your majesty  , we will hide  .
ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may color your loneliness  .
ophelia read from this prayer book  , so it looks natural that you 're all alone  .
we are oft to blame in this  , 't is too much proved  , that with devotion 's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself  .
come to think of it  , this happens all the time people act devoted to god to mask their bad deeds  .
oh  , 't is too true  !
how right he is  !
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience  !
his words whip up my guilty feelings  .
the harlot 's cheek  , beautied with plastering art  , is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word  .
the whore 's pockmarked cheek made pretty with make - up is just like the ugly actions i 'm disguising with fine words  .
o heavy burden  !
what a terrible guilt i feel  !
i hear him coming  .
i hear him coming  .
let 's withdraw  , my lord  .
quick  , let 's hide  , my lord  .
good my lord  , how does your honor for this many a day  ?
hello  , my lord  , how have you been doing lately  ?
i humbly thank you  .
very well  , thank you  .
well  , well  , well  .
well  , well  , well  .
my lord  , i have remembrances of yours that i have longd long to redeliver  .
my lord  , i have some mementos of yours that i 've been meaning to give back to you for a long time now  .
i pray you now receive them  .
please take them  .
no  , not i .
no  , it was n't me  .
i never gave you aught  .
i never gave you anything  .
take these again  , for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind  .
their value when the givers turn out not to be so nice  .
there  , my lord  .
there  , my lord  .
ha  , ha  , are you honest  ?
ha ha  , are you good  ?
my lord  ?
excuse me  ?
are you fair  ?
are you beautiful  ?
what means your lordship  ?
my lord  , what are you talking about  ?
that if you be honest and fair  , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty  .
i 'm just saying that if you 're good and beautiful  , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty  .
could beauty  , my lord  , have better commerce than with honesty  ?
but could beauty be related to anything better than goodness  ?
ay  , truly  , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness  .
sure  , since beauty 's power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin  .
this was sometime a paradox  , but now the time gives it proof  .
this used to be a great puzzle  , but now i 've solved it  .
i did love you once  .
i used to love you  .
indeed  , my lord  , you made me believe so  .
you certainly made me believe you did  , my lord  .
you should not have believed me  , for virtue can not so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it  .
you should n't have believed me  , since we 're all rotten at the core  , no matter how hard we try to be virtuous  .
i loved you not  .
i did n't love you  .
i was the more deceived  .
then i guess i was misled  .
i am very proud  , revengeful  , ambitious  , with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in  , imagination to give them shape  , or time to act them in  .
i am arrogant  , vengeful  , ambitious  , with more ill will in me than i can fit into my thoughts  , and more than i have time to carry it out in  .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven  ?
why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven  ?
we are arrant knaves  , all  .
every one of us is a criminal  .
believe none of us  .
do n't believe any of us  .
go thy ways to a nunnery  .
hurry to a convent  .
where 's your father  ?
where 's your father  ?
at home  , my lord  .
he 's at home  , my lord  .
let the doors be shut upon him  , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house  .
lock him in  , so he can play the fool in his own home only  .
farewell  .
good - bye  .
o  , help him  , you sweet heavens  !
oh  , dear god  , please help him  !
heavenly powers  , restore him  !
dear god  , please make him normal again  !
i have heard of your paintings too  , well enough  .
i 've heard all about you women and your cosmetics too  .
god has given you one face and you make yourselves another  .
god gives you one face  , but you paint another on top of it  .
you jig and amble  , and you lisp  , you nickname god 's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance  .
you dance and prance and lisp  ; you call god 's creations by pet names  , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance  .
go to  , i 'll no more on 't  .
come on  , i wo n't stand for it anymore  .
it hath made me mad  .
it 's driven me crazy  .
i say  , we will have no more marriages  .
i hereby declare we will have no more marriage  .
those that are married already  , all but one  , shall live  .
whoever is already married  ( except one person i know  ) will stay married all but one person  .
the rest shall keep as they are  .
everyone else will have to stay single  .
to a nunnery  , go  .
get yourself to a convent  , fast  .
it shall do well  .
it should work  .
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love  .
but i still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love  .
how now  , ophelia  ?
hello  , ophelia  .
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said  .
you do n't have to tell us what lord hamlet said  .
it shall be so  .
that 's how we 'll do it  , then  .
madness in great ones must not unwatched go  .
when important people start to show signs of insanity  , you have to watch them closely  .
i warrant your honor  .
i will  , sir  .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us  , sir  .
i hope we 've corrected that fault pretty well in our company  , sir  .
and the queen too  , and that presently  .
yes  , he will  , and the queen as well  .
bid the players make haste  .
tell the actors to hurry  .
will you two help to hasten them  ?
will you two help them get ready  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
what ho  , horatio  !
well  , hello there  , horatio  !
here  , sweet lord  , at your service  .
here i am at your service  , my dear lord  .
horatio  , thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal  .
horatio  , you 're the best man i 've ever known  .
o my dear lord
oh  , sir
nay  , do not think i flatter  .
do n't think i 'm flattering you  .
for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits  , to feed and clothe thee  ?
what could i hope to get from you  , who 've got nothing but your charm to support you in life  ?
why should the poor be flattered  ?
why would anyone flatter a poor person  ?
no  , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp  , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning  .
no  , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well  .
dost thou hear  ?
you understand  ?
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish  , her election hath sealed thee for herself  , for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune 's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks  .
ever since i 've been a free agent in my choice of friends  , i 've chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance  , grateful for both good and bad  .
and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commingled  , that they are not a pipe for fortune 's finger to sound what stop she please  .
blessed are those who mix emotion with reason in just the right proportion  , making them strong enough to resist the whims of lady luck  .
give me that man that is not passion 's slave  , and i will wear him in my heart 's core  , ay  , in my heart of heart  , as i do thee  .
show me the person who 's master of his emotions  , and i 'll put him close to my heart in my heart of hearts as i do you  .
something too much of this  .
but i 'm talking too much  .
there is a play tonight before the king  .
the point is  , there 's a play being performed for the king tonight  .
one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father 's death  .
one of the scenes comes very close to depicting the circumstances of my father 's death  , as i described them to you  .
i prithee  , when thou seest that act afoot  , even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle  .
watch my uncle carefully when that scene begins  .
if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech  , it is a damnd ghost that we have seen  , and my imaginations are as foul
if his guilty secret does not reveal itself  , then that ghost was just a devil  , and my hunch was n't  , in fact  , worth anything  .
well  , my lord  .
my lord  , i 'll watch him as closely as i would a thief  .
if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing  , and 'scape detecting  , i will pay the theft  .
i wo n't miss a trick  .
they are coming to the play  .
they 're coming  .
i must be idle  .
i ca n't talk now  .
get you a place  .
take your seat  .
how fares our cousin hamlet  ?
so how 's my nephew hamlet doing  ?
excellent  , i ' faith  , of the chameleon 's dish  .
wonderful  !
i eat the air  , promise - crammed  .
i eat the air  , like chameleons do  .
you can not feed capons so  .
i 'm positively stuffed with air  , i eat so much of it  .
i have nothing with this answer  , hamlet  .
i have no idea what you 're talking about  , hamlet  .
these words are not mine  .
you 're not answering my question  .
no  , nor mine now  .
mine  , neither  .
polonius my lord  , you played once i ' th ' university  , you say  ?

i did enact julius caesar  .
i played julius caesar  .
i was killed i ' th ' capitol  .
i was killed in the capitol  .
brutus killed me  .
brutus killed me  .
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there  .
that was brutish of them  , to kill so capital a guy  .
be the players ready  ?
are the actors ready  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
they stay upon your patience  .
they 're ready whenever you are  .
no  , good mother  .
no thanks  , my good mother  .
here 's metal more attractive  .
there 's a nicer piece of work right here  .
ophelia

claudius oh  , ho  , do you mark that  ?
claudius hey  , did you notice that  ?
lady  , shall i lie in your lap  ?
my lady  , should i lie in your lap  ?
no  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  .
i mean  , my head upon your lap  ?
i mean  , with my head in your lap  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
do you think i meant country matters  ?
did you think i was talking about sex  ?
i think nothing  , my lord  .
i think  , my lord  .
that 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs  .
that 's a nice thought to lie between a girl 's legs  .
what is  , my lord  ?
what is  , my lord  ?
nothing  .
nothing  .
you are merry  , my lord  .
you 're in a good mood tonight  , my lord  .
who  , i  ?
who  , me  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
o god  , your only jig - maker  .
oh god who is  , by the way  , the best comic of them all  .
what should a man do but be merry  ?
what can you do but be happy  ?
for  , look you  , how cheerfully my mother looks  , and my father died within these two hours  .
look how cheerful my mother is  , only two hours after my father died  .
nay  , 't is twice two months  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  , it 's been four months  .
so long  ?
as long as that  ?
nay then  , let the devil wear black  , for i 'll have a suit of sables  .
well  , in that case these mourning clothes can go to hell  .
o heavens  !
i 'll get myself a fur - trimmed suit  .
die two months ago and not forgotten yet  ?
good heavens  , he died two months ago and has n't been forgotten yet  ?
then there 's hope a great man 's memory may outlive his life half a year  .
in that case  , there 's reason to hope a man 's memory may outlive him by six months  .
but  , by 'r lady  , he must build churches then  , or else shall he suffer not thinking on  , with the hobby - horse  , whose epitaph is for  , oh  , for  , oh  , the hobby - horse is forgot  .
but he 's got to build churches for that to happen  , my lady  , or else he 'll have to put up with being forgotten  , like the hobby - horse in the popular song that goes  , heigh - ho  , heigh - ho  , the hobby - horse is forgotten  .
what means this  , my lord  ?
what does this mean  , my lord  ?
belike this show imports the argument of the play  .
this pantomime was probably a summary of the play  .
we shall know by this fellow  .
this guy will tell us everything  .
the players can not keep counsel  .
actors ca n't keep a secret  .
they 'll tell all  .
they 'll tell all  .
will he tell us what this show meant  ?
will he tell us what that pantomime meant  ?
ay  , or any show that you will show him  .
sure  , or anything else you show him  .
be not you ashamed to show  , he 'll not shame to tell you what it means  .
as long as you are n't ashamed to show it  , he wo n't be ashamed to tell you what it means  .
you are naught  , you are naught  .
you 're naughty  .
i 'll mark the play  .
i 'm watching the play  .
 ,  ,  .

was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring  ?
't is brief  , my lord  .

you are as good as a chorus  , my lord  .
you 're an expert commentator  , are n't you  ?
you are keen  , my lord  , you are keen  .
ooh  , you 're sharp  .
it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge  .
yes  , pointy  , but you could take the edge off me though it might make you moan a little  .
still better and worse  .
you get better in your jokes and worse in your manners  .
so you must take your husbands  .
that 's what you women get when you trick us into marriage  .
begin  , murderer  .
let 's get started  , murderer on stage  , please  !
pox  , leave thy damnable faces  , and begin  .
damn it  , stop fussing with the makeup  , and get going  .
come  , the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge
we 're all waiting for the revenge  !
he poisons him i ' th ' garden for 's estate  .
you see  , he poisons the king in his own garden to get the kingdom for himself  .
his name 's gonzago  .
the king 's name is gonzago  .
the story is extant  , and writ in choice italian  .
the original story was written in the finest italian  .
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago 's wife  .
you 'll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of gonzago 's wife  .
the king rises  .
the king is getting up  .

lights  , lights  , lights  !

,  .
you might have rhymed  .
you could have at least  .
o good horatio  , i 'll take the ghost 's word for a thousand pound  .
oh  , horatio  , i 'll bet you a thousand bucks the ghost was right  .
didst perceive  ?
did you notice  ?
very well  , my lord  .
yes  , i did  , my lord  .
upon the talk of the poisoning  ?
when the actors were talking about poison  ?
i did very well note him  .
i watched him very closely  .
ah ha  !
ah ha  !

come  , the recorders  !
play your flutes  !
,  .
,  .
come  , some music  !
come on  , music  !
good my lord  , vouchsafe me a word with you  .
my lord  , could i have a word with you  ?
sir  , a whole history  .
you can have a whole story  , not just a word  .
the king  , sir
sir  , the king
ay  , sir  , what of him  ?
yes  , what about him  ?
is in his retirement marvelous distempered  .
he 's in his chambers now  , and he 's extremely upset  .
with drink  , sir  ?
what  , an upset stomach from too much booze  ?
no  , my lord  , with choler  .
no  , sir  , he 's angry  .
good my lord  , put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair  .
my lord  , please try to stick to the subject at hand  .
i am tame  , sir  .
i 'll be good  , sir  .
pronounce  .
go ahead  .
the queen your mother  , in most great affliction of spirit  , hath sent me to you  .
the queen your mother is upset  , and sent me to see you  .
you are welcome  .
it 's lovely to see you  .
nay  , good my lord  , this courtesy is not of the right breed  .
no  , my lord  , your polite words are not to the point  .
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer  , i will do your mother 's commandment  .
if you could please stop fooling around  , i 'll tell you what your mother wants  .
if not  , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business  .
if not  , i 'll leave you alone and that 'll be the end of my business  .
sir  , i can not  .
sir  , i ca n't  .
what  , my lord  ?
ca n't what  , my lord  ?
then thus she says  : your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration  .
she says that your behavior has astonished her  .
o wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother  !
oh  , what a wonderful son  , i can impress my mother  !
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother 's admiration  ?
but what 's the upshot of her admiration  ?
impart  .
do tell  .
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed  .
she wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed  .
we shall obey  , were she ten times our mother  .
i 'd obey even if she were my mother ten times over  .
have you any further trade with us  ?
is there anything else i can do for you  ?
my lord  , you once did love me  .
my lord  , you used to like me  .
and do still  , by these pickers and stealers  .
and still do  , i swear by my hands  .
good my lord  , what is your cause of distemper  ?
my lord  , what 's wrong with you  ?
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend  .
you 're not doing yourself any good by refusing to tell your friends what 's bothering you  .
sir  , i lack advancement  .
sir  , i have no future ahead of me  .
how can that be  , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark  ?
but how can you say that  , when the king himself says you 're the heir to the danish throne  ?
i do not well understand that  .
i do n't really understand what you mean  .
will you play upon this pipe  ?
will you play this recorder  ?
my lord  , i can not  .
i ca n't  , my lord  .
i pray you  .
please  .
believe me  , i can not  .
i 'm serious  , i ca n't  .
i do beseech you  .
i 'm begging you  .
i know no touch of it  , my lord  .
i have no idea how  .
it is as easy as lying  .
oh  , it 's as easy as lying  .
govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb  , give it breath with your mouth  , and it will discourse most eloquent music  .
just put your fingers and thumb over the holes and blow into it  , and it 'll produce the most moving music  .
look you  , these are the stops  .
here  , the holes are here  .
but these can not i command to any utterance of harmony  .
but i ca n't play a melody  .
i have not the skill  .
i do n't know how  .
god bless you  , sir  .
hello and god bless you  , sir  .
my lord  , the queen would speak with you  , and presently  .
my lord  , the queen wants to speak with you right away  .
do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel  ?
do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel  ?
by th ' mass  , and 't is like a camel indeed  .
by god  , it does look like a camel  .
methinks it is like a weasel  .
to me it looks like a weasel  .
it is backed like a weasel  .
it does have a back like a weasel 's  .
or like a whale  .
or like a whale  .
very like a whale  .
yes  , very much like a whale  .
then i will come to my mother by and by  .
i 'll go see my mother soon  .
they fool me to the top of my bent  .
they 're trying as hard as they can to mess with me  .
i will come by and by  .
i will go soon  .
i will say so  .
i 'll tell her  .
by and by is easily said  .
it 's easy enough to say soon  .
leave me  , friends  .
now please leave me alone  , my friends  .
i like him not  , nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range  .
i do n't like the way he 's acting  , and it 's not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control  .
therefore prepare you  .
so get prepared  .
i your commission will forthwith dispatch  , and he to england shall along with you  .
i 'm sending you to england on diplomatic business  , and hamlet will go with you  .
the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies  .
as king  , i can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour  .
we will ourselves provide  .
we 'll take care of it  .
most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many  , many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty  .
it 's a sacred duty to protect the lives of all those who depend on your highness  .
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armor of the mind to keep itself from noyance  , but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many  .
everyone tries to avoid harm  , but the public figure demands even more protection  .
the cease of majesty dies not alone  , but  , like a gulf  , doth draw what 's near it with it  .
when a great leader dies he does n't die alone but  , like a whirlpool  , draws others with him  .
it is a massy wheel fixed on the summit of the highest mount  , to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoined  , which  , when it falls  , each small annexment  , petty consequence  , attends the boisterous ruin  .
he 's like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things when it falls down the mountain  , every little object goes down with it  .
never alone did the king sigh  , but with a general groan  .
whenever a king sighs  , everyone groans  .
arm you  , i pray you  , to this speedy voyage  .
prepare yourself  , please  , for this trip  .
for we will fetters put upon this fear  , which now goes too free - footed  .
we 'll put a leash on this danger that 's now running wild  .
we will haste us  .
we 'll hurry  .
my lord  , he 's going to his mother 's closet  .
my lord  , hamlet 's going to his mother 's room  .
behind the arras i 'll convey myself to hear the process  .
i 'll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say  .
i 'll warrant she 'll tax him home  .
i bet she 'll chew him out  .
and  , as you said  ( and wisely was it said  ) 't is meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should o'erhear the speech  , of vantage  .
and as you said  ( and you said it wisely  )  , it 's good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them  , since she can be too partial to him  .
fare you well  , my liege  .
goodbye  , my lord  .
i 'll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know  .
i 'll stop by before you go to bed  , and tell you what i 've heard  .
thanks  , dear my lord  .
thanks  , my dear lord  .
that can not be  , since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder  : my crown  , mine own ambition  , and my queen  .
that wo n't work  , since i 'm still reaping the rewards of that murder  : my crown and my queen  .
may one be pardoned and retain th ' offense  ?
can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime  ?
in the corrupted currents of this world offense 's gilded hand may shove by justice  , and oft 't is seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law  .
in this wicked world  , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law  , shoving justice aside  .
but 't is not so above  .
but not in heaven  .
there is no shuffling  .
up there  , every action is judged for exactly what it 's worth  , and we 're forced to confront our crimes  .
there the action lies in his true nature  , and we ourselves compelled  , even to the teeth and forehead of our faults  , to give in evidence  .
so what can i do  ?
what then  ?
what is there left to do  ?
what rests  ?
offer whatever repentance i can that could n't hurt  .
try what repentance can  .
but it ca n't help either  !
what can it not  ?
oh  , what a lousy situation i 'm in  .
yet what can it when one can not repent  ?
my heart 's as black as death  .
o wretched state  !
my soul is stuck to sin  , and the more it struggles to break free  , the more it sticks  .
o bosom black as death  !
help me  , angels  !
o limd soul that  , struggling to be free  , art more engaged  !
c'mon  , make an effort  .
help  , angels  .
bend  , stubborn knees  .
make assay  .
steely heart  , be soft as a newborn babe  , so i can pray  .
bow  , stubborn knees  , and  , heart with strings of steel  , be soft as sinews of the newborn babe  .
perhaps everything will turn out okay after all  .
all may be well  .
(
my words fly up  , my thoughts remain below  .
my words fly up toward heaven  , but my thoughts stay down here on earth  .
words without thoughts never to heaven go  .
words without thoughts behind them will never make it to heaven  .
he will come straight  .
he 'll come right away  .
look you lay home to him  .
make sure you lay into him  .
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with  , and that your grace hath screened and stood between much heat and him  .
tell him his pranks have caused too much trouble  , and that your highness has taken a lot of heat for them  .
i 'll silence me even here  .
i 'll be right here  , silent  .
pray you  , be round with him  .
please be blunt with him  .
mother  , mother  , mother  !
mother  , mother  , mother  !
now mother  , what 's the matter  ?
now mother  , what 's this all about  ?
hamlet  , thou hast thy father much offended  .
hamlet  , you 've insulted your father  .
mother  , you have my father much offended  .
mother  , you 've insulted my father  .
come  , come  , you answer with an idle tongue  .
come on  , you 're answering me foolishly  .
go  , go  , you question with a wicked tongue  .
go on  , you 're questioning me evilly  .
why  , how now  , hamlet  ?
hamlet  , what  , why  ?
what 's the matter now  ?
what 's the problem now  ?
have you forgot me  ?
have you forgotten who i am  ?
nay  , then i 'll set those to you that can speak  .
in that case i 'll call in others who can still speak  .
what wilt thou do  ?
what are you going to do  ?
thou wilt not murder me  ?
you wo n't kill me  , will you  ?
help  , help  , ho  !
help  !
what  , ho  ?
hey  !
help  , help  , help  !
help  , help  , help  !
how now  , a rat  ?
what 's this  , a rat  ?
dead for a ducat  , dead  !
i 'll bet a buck he 's a dead rat now  .
oh  , i am slain  .
oh  , i 've been killed  !
o me  , what hast thou done  ?
oh my god  , what have you done  ?
nay  , i know not  .
i do n't know  .
is it the king  ?
is it the king  ?
oh  , what a rash and bloody deed is this  !
oh  , what a senseless  , horrible act  !
as kill a king  ?
killing a king  ?
ay  , lady  , 't was my word  .
that 's what i said  , my good woman  .
what have i done  , that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me  ?
what have i done that you dare to talk to me so rudely  ?
such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty  , calls virtue hypocrite  , takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there  , makes marriage vows as false as dicers ' oaths oh  , such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul  , and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words  .
a deed that destroys modesty  , turns virtue into hypocrisy  , replaces the blossom on the face of true love with a nasty blemish  , makes marriage vows as false as a gambler 's oath oh  , you 've done a deed that plucks the soul out of marriage and turns religion into meaningless blather  .
heaven 's face doth glow o'er this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage  , as against the doom  , is thought - sick at the act  .
heaven looks down on this earth  , as angry as if judgment day were here  , and is sick at the thought of what you 've done  .
ay me  , what act that roars so loud and thunders in the index  ?
c'mon  , what 's this deed that sounds so awful even before i know what it is  ?
to give the world assurance of a man  .
that was your husband  .
this was your husband  .
now look at this other one  .
look you now  , what follows  .
here is your present husband  , like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy one next to it  .
here is your husband  , like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother  .
do you have eyes  ?
have you eyes  ?
how could you leave the lofty heights of this man here and descend as low as this one  ?
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor  ?
ha  !
ha  , have you eyes  ?
do you have eyes  ?
you can not call it love  , for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame  , it 's humble  , and waits upon the judgment  .
you can not say you did it out of love  , since at your age romantic passions have grown weak  , and the heart obeys reason  .
and what judgment would step from this to this  ?
but what reason could move you from this one to that one  ?
sense sure you have  , else could you not have motion  .
you must have some sense in your head  , since you 're able to get around  , but it seems to be paralyzed  , since even if you were crazy you would know the difference between these two men  .
but sure that sense is apoplexed  , for madness would not err  , nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled  , but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference  .
no one ever went so insane that they could n't get an easy choice like this one right  .
what devil was 't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman - blind  ?
what devil was it that blindfolded you  ?
eyes without feeling  , feeling without sight  , ears without hands or eyes  , smelling sans all  , or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope  .
eyes without feeling  , feeling without sight  , ears without hands or eyes  , smell without anything else  , the use of even one impaired sense would not permit such a mistake as yours  .
o shame  , where is thy blush  ?
oh  , for shame  , why are n't you blushing  ?
rebellious hell  , if thou canst mutine in a matron 's bones  , to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire  .
if evil can overtake even an old mother 's bones  , then let it melt my own  .
proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardor gives the charge  , since frost itself as actively doth burn  , and reason panders will  .
it turns out it 's no longer shameful to act on impulse now that the old are doing so  , and now that reason is a servant to desire  .
o hamlet  , speak no more  !
oh  , hamlet  , stop  !
thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul  , and there i see such black and graind spots as will not leave their tinct  .
you 're making me look into my very soul  , where the marks of sin are so thick and black they will never be washed away  .
nay  , but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamd bed  , stewed in corruption  , honeying and making love over the nasty sty
yes  , and you lie in the sweaty stench of your dirty sheets  , wet with corruption  , making love
o  , speak to me no more  !
oh  , you must stop  !
these words like daggers enter in my ears  .
your words are like daggers  .
no more  , sweet hamlet  .
please  , no more  , sweet hamlet  .
a murderer and a villain  , a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord  , a vice of kings  , a cutpurse of the empire and the rule  , that from a shelf the precious diadem stole  , and put it in his pocket
a murderer and a villain  , a low - life who 's not worth a twentieth of a tenth of your first husband the worst of kings  , a thief of the throne  , who took the precious crown from a shelf and put it in his pocket
no more  !
stop  !
a king of shreds and patches
a ragtag king
save me and hover o'er me with your wings  , you heavenly guards  !
oh  , angels in heaven  , protect me with your wings  !
what would your gracious figure  ?
what can i do for you  , my gracious lord  ?
do you not come your tardy son to chide  , that  , lapsed in time and passion  , lets go by the important acting of your dread command  ?
have you come to scold your tardy son for straying from his mission  , letting your important command slip by  ?
o  , say  !
tell me  !
do not forget  .
do n't forget  .
this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose  .
i 've come to sharpen your somewhat dull appetite for revenge  .
but look  , amazement on thy mother sits  .
but look  , your mother is in shock  .
o  , step between her and her fighting soul  .
oh  , keep her struggling soul from being overwhelmed by horrid visions  .
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works  .
the imagination works strongest in those with the weakest bodies  .
speak to her  , hamlet  .
talk to her  , hamlet  .
how is it with you  , lady  ?
how are you doing  , madam  ?
alas  , how is 't with you  , that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with th ' incorporal air do hold discourse  ?
and how are doing  , staring into the empty air and talking to nobody  ?
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep  , and  , as the sleeping soldiers in th ' alarm  , your bedded hair  , like life in excrements  , starts up and stands on end  .
your eyes give away your wild thoughts  , and your hair is standing upright  , like soldiers during a call to arms  .
o gentle son  , upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience  .
oh my dear son  , calm yourself and cool off your overheated mind  !
whereon do you look  ?
what are you staring at  ?
to whom do you speak this  ?
who are you talking to  ?
do you see nothing there  ?
you do n't see anything  ?
nothing at all  , yet all that is i see  .
nothing at all  , but i can see everything that 's here  .
nor did you nothing hear  ?
and you do n't hear anything  ?
no  , nothing but ourselves  .
no  , nothing but us talking  .
this the very coinage of your brain  .
this is only a figment of your imagination  .
this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in  .
madness is good at creating hallucinations  .
ecstasy  ?
madness  ?
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music  .
my heart beats just as evenly as yours does  .
it is not madness that i have uttered  .
there 's nothing crazy in what i 've just uttered  .
bring me to the test  , and i the matter will reword  , which madness would gambol from  .
put me to the test  .
mother  , for love of grace  , lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks  .
i 'll rephrase everything i 've just said  , which a lunatic could n't do  .
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whilst rank corruption  , mining all within  , infects unseen  .
mother  , for the love of god  , do n't flatter yourself into believing that it 's my madness  , not your crime  , that 's the problem  .
confess yourself to heaven  .
you 'd just be concealing the rot that 's eating you from the inside  .
repent what 's past  .
confess your sins to heaven  .
avoid what is to come  .
repent and avoid damnation  .
and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker  .
do n't spread manure over the weeds in your heart  ; it 'll only make them more filthy  .
forgive me this my virtue  , for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg  , yea  , curb and woo for leave to do him good  .
forgive me my good intentions here since in these fat and spoiled times  , virtuous people have to say  , beg your pardon to vile ones and beg for the chance to do any good  .
o hamlet  , thou hast cleft my heart in twain  .
oh hamlet  , you 've broken my heart in two  !
what shall i do  ?
what should i do  ?
i must to england  , you know that  ?
i have to go to england  , do n't you know that  ?
alack  , i had forgot  .
ah  , i 'd forgotten all about that  !
't is so concluded on  .
it 's been decided  .
there 's letters sealed  , and my two schoolfellows  , whom i will trust as i will adders fanged  , they bear the mandate  .
yes  , it 's a done deal  , the documents are ready  , and my two schoolmates  , whom i trust about as much as rattlesnakes  , are in charge  .
they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery  .
they 're the ones who 'll lead me on my march to mischief  .
let it work  , for 't is the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard  .
let it happen  .
and 't shall go hard  , but i will delve one yard below their mines  , and blow them at the moon  .
it 's fun to watch the engineer get blown up by his own explosives  , and with any luck i 'll dig a few feet below their bombs and blow them to the moon  .
oh  , 't is most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet  .
oh  , it 's nice to kill two birds with one stone  .
polonius this man shall set me packing  .
( polonius now that i 've killed this guy  , i 'll be off in a hurry  .
i 'll lug the guts into the neighbor room  .
i 'll lug his guts into the next room  .
mother  , good night  .
mother  , have a good night  .
indeed this counselor is now most still  , most secret  , and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave  .
this politician who was in life a babbling idiot is now quiet and serious  .
come  , sir  , to draw toward an end with you  .
come on  , sir  , let 's get to the end of our business  .
good night  , mother  .
good night  , mother  .
gertrude there 's matter in these sighs  , these profound heaves  .
gertrude these deep  , heaving sighs of yours mean something  .
you must translate  .
you have to tell me what  .
't is fit we understand them  .
i need to know  .
where is your son  ?
where 's your son  ?
rosencrantz guildenstern bestow this place on us a little while  .
rosencrantz guildenstern let us speak privately awhile  , please  .
ah  , my good lord  , what have i seen tonight  !
ah  , my lord  , you would n't believe what i 've witnessed tonight  !
what  , gertrude  ?
what  , gertrude  ?
how does hamlet  ?
how is hamlet  ?
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier  .
as mad as the waves and the wind when they struggle together in a storm  .
in his lawless fit  , behind the arras hearing something stir  , whips out his rapier  , cries  , a rat  , a rat  !
in an insane rage  , he hears something behind the tapestry  , whips out his sword  , shouts  , a rat  , a rat  !
and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man  .
and in his deranged state of mind he kills the good old man  , who is still hidden  .
but  , like the owner of a foul disease  , to keep it from divulging  , let it feed even on the pith of life  .
the core  , i kept hamlet 's condition secret and let it grow more and more dangerous  .
where is he gone  ?
where has he gone  ?
friends both  , go join you with some further aid  .
my friends  , go find others to help you  .
hamlet in madness hath polonius slain  , and from his mother 's closet hath he dragged him  .
hamlet in his madness has killed polonius and dragged him out of his mother 's bedroom  .
go seek him out  , speak fair  , and bring the body into the chapel  .
go find him and speak nicely to him  , and bring the corpse into the chapel  .
i pray you  , haste in this  .
please hurry  .
safely stowed  .
the body is safely hidden  .
but soft  , what noise  ?
what 's that noise  ?
who calls on hamlet  ?
who 's calling for hamlet  ?
oh  , here they come  .
oh  , here they come  .
what have you done  , my lord  , with the dead body  ?
what have you done with the corpse  , my lord  ?
compounded it with dust  , whereto 't is kin  .
i 've gotten it dirty ashes to ashes  , and dust to dust  .
tell us where 't is  , that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel  .
but tell us where it is  , so we can take it to the chapel  .
do not believe it  .
do n't believe it  .
believe what  ?
believe what  ?
that i can keep your counsel and not mine own  .
that i 'd take your advice rather than keep my own secret  .
besides  , to be demanded of a sponge  !
besides  , you 're a sponge  !
what replication should be made by the son of a king  ?
what is the son of a king supposed to say to a sponge  ?
take you me for a sponge  , my lord  ?
you think i 'm a sponge  , my lord  ?
i understand you not  , my lord  .
i do n't follow  , my lord  .
i am glad of it  .
i 'm glad about that  .
a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear  .
sly words are never understood by fools  .
my lord  , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king  .
my lord  , you have to tell us where the body is  , and then go with us to see the king  .
the body is with the king  , but the king is not with the body  .
the body 's with the king  , but the king 's not with the body  .
the king is a thing
the king 's a thing
a thing  , my lord  ?
a thing  , my lord  ?
of nothing  .
a thing of no importance  .
bring me to him  .
take me to him  .
hide  , fox  , and all after  .
ready or not  , here i come  !
i have sent to seek him and to find the body  .
i 've sent men to find him and retrieve the body  .
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose  !
how dangerous to have this madman on the loose  !
yet must not we put the strong law on him  .
but we ca n't throw him in jail  .
he 's loved of the distracted multitude  , who like not in their judgment  , but their eyes  .
the people love him  , because they judge based on appearance rather than reason  .
and where 't is so  , th ' offender 's scourge is weighed  , but never the offense  .
they 'll pay attention to the severity of the punishment  , not the severity of the crime  .
to bear all smooth and even  , this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause  .
no  , we must seem calm and fair - minded  , and our sending him away must seem like a carefully considered move  .
diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved  , or not at all  .
but a terminal disease requires extreme treatment  , or nothing at all  .
how now  , what hath befall'n  ?
so what 's happened  ?
where the dead body is bestowed  , my lord  , we can not get from him  .
we ca n't get him to tell us where he 's put the body  .
but where is he  ?
but where is he  ?
without  , my lord  ; guarded  , to know your pleasure  .
outside  , my lord  , under guard  , waiting for your orders  .
bring him before us  .
bring him to me  .
ho  , guildenstern  !
hey  , guildenstern  !
bring in my lord  .
bring in my lord  .
now  , hamlet  , where 's polonius  ?
now  , hamlet  , where 's polonius  ?
at supper  .
at dinner  .
at supper where  ?
at dinner where  ?
not where he eats  , but where he is eaten  .
not where he 's eating  , but where he 's being eaten  .
a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him  .
a certain is chowing down on him  .
your worm is your only emperor for diet  .
worms are the emperor of all diets  .
we fat all creatures else to fat us  , and we fat ourselves for maggots  .
we fatten up all creatures to feed ourselves  , and we fatten ourselves for the worms to eat when we 're dead  .
your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes  , but to one table  .
a fat king and a skinny beggar are just two dishes at the same meal  .
that 's the end  .
that 's all i have to say  .
alas  , alas  !
oh no  , oh no  !
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king  , and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm  .
a man can fish with the worm that ate a king  , and then eat the fish he catches with that worm  .
what dost you mean by this  ?
what do you mean by that  ?
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar  .
nothing much  , just to demonstrate that a king can move through the bowels of a beggar  .
where is polonius  ?
where is polonius  ?
in heaven  .
in heaven  .
send hither to see  .
send a messager there if you want to be sure  .
if your messenger find him not there  , seek him i ' th ' other place yourself  .
if your messenger ca n't find him  , you can check hell yourself  .
but if indeed you find him not within this month  , you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby  .
but seriously  , if you do n't find him within the next month  , you 'll be sure to smell him as you go upstairs into the main hall  .
go seek him there  .
go look for him there  .
he will stay till ye come  .
no need to hurry  , he 's not going anywhere  .

thy loving father  , hamlet  .
i 'm your father  , hamlet your father who loves you  .
my mother  .
you 're my mother  .
father and mother is man and wife  , man and wife is one flesh  , and so  , my mother  .
when you married my mother  , the two of you became one flesh  , so if you 're my father you 're also my mother  .
come  , for england  !
come on  , off to england  !
i will do 't  , my lord  .
i 'll tell him  , my lord  .
go softly on  .

good sir  , whose powers are these  ?
sir  , whose troops are these  ?
they are of norway  , sir  .
the king of norway 's  , sir  .
how purposed  , sir  , i pray you  ?
what are they doing here  , sir  ?
against some part of poland  .
they 're on their way to invade some part of poland  .
who commands them  , sir  ?
who 's commanding them  , sir  ?
the nephew to old norway  , fortinbras  .
the nephew of the old king of norway  , fortinbras  .
goes it against the main of poland  , sir  , or for some frontier  ?
is he attacking the heartland of poland or some frontier  ?
truly to speak  , and with no addition  , we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name  .
to tell the truth  , we 're fighting to win a little patch of ground that 's not worth anything  .
to pay five ducats  , five  , i would not farm it  .
i myself would n't pay five ducats for it  , if someone offered it to me to farm  .
nor will it yield to norway or the pole a ranker rate  , should it be sold in fee  .
and it wo n't provide any more profits than that to either the norwegian or the pole  .
why  , then the polack never will defend it  .
so then the poles wo n't be willing to defend it  .
god be wi ' you  , sir  .
good - bye  , sir  .
will 't please you go  , my lord  ?
will you please come now  , my lord  ?
i 'll be with you straight  .
i 'll be there in a minute  .
go a little before  .
start without me  .
i will not speak with her  .
i wo n't speak to her  .
what would she have  ?
what does she want  ?
'twere good she were spoken with  , for she may strew dangerous conjectures in ill - breeding minds  .
it 's a good idea to speak to her  , since she might lead those with evil intentions to dangerous conclusions  .
let her come in  .
show her in  .
to my sick soul  ( as sin 's true nature is  ) each toy seems prologue to some great amiss  .
to my sick soul  ( since sin is always a sickness  )  , every detail looks like an omen of disaster to come  .
so full of artless jealousy is guilt  , it spills itself in fearing to be spilt  .
guilt makes you so full of stupid suspicions that you give yourself away because you 're trying so hard not to  .

she 's talking about her dead father  .
pray you  , let 's have no words of this  , but when they ask you what it means  , say you this  :  ,  ,  ,  .

how long hath she been thus  ?
how long has she been like this  ?
follow her close  .
follow her  .
give her good watch  , i pray you  .
keep an eye on her  , please  .
oh  , this is the poison of deep grief  .
oh  , her grief has poisoned her mind  .
it springs all from her father 's death  , and now behold  !
her father died and now look at her  !
o gertrude  , gertrude  , when sorrows come  , they come not single spies but in battalions  .
oh  , gertrude  , gertrude  , when bad things happen  , they do n't come one at a time  , like enemy spies  , but all at once like an army  .
first  , her father slain  .
first her father was killed  , then your son was taken away because of his own violent actions  .
next  , your son gone  , and he most violent author of his own just remove  .
the people are confused and spreading nasty rumors about polonius 's death  , and i was a fool to bury him in a hurry  , without a proper state funeral  .
the people muddied  , thick  , and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius ' death  , and we have done but greenly in hugger - mugger to inter him  .
poor ophelia has been robbed of her sanity  , without which we 're just pictures  , or animals  .
poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment  , without the which we are pictures  , or mere beasts  .
last but not least  , her brother has secretly returned from france and is surrounded by gossip - mongers  , who fill his ears with wicked stories about his father 's death  .
last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france  , feeds on his wonder  , keeps himself in clouds  , and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father 's death  , wherein necessity  , of matter beggared  , will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear  .
deprived of proper evidence  , he 'll naturally attribute the murder to me  .
o my dear gertrude  , this  , like to a murdering piece  , in many places gives me superfluous death  .
oh  , dear gertrude  , i feel as though i 'm being murdered many times over  .
alack  , what noise is this  ?
oh  , no what 's that noise  ?
what is the matter  ?
what is it  ?
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry  .
they sound so cheerful as they hunt down the wrong prey  !
o  , this is counter  , you false danish dogs  !
oh  , you 're on the wrong track  , you disloyal danish dogs  !
the doors are broke  .
the doors have been smashed open  .
where is this king  ?
where 's this so - called king  ?
sirs  , stand you all without  .
men  , wait outside  .
no  , let 's come in  !
no  , let us in  !
i pray you  , give me leave  .
please wait  .
we will  , we will  .
all right  , we will  , we will  .
i thank you  .
thank you  .
keep the door  .
guard the door  .
o thou vile king  , give me my father  !
( claudius  ) oh  , you vile king  , give me my father  !
calmly  , good laertes  .
calm down  , good laertes  .
what is the cause  , laertes  , that thy rebellion looks so giant - like  ?
laertes  , what makes you so rebellious  ?
let him go  , gertrude  .
let him go  , gertrude  .
do not fear our person  .
do n't worry about my getting hurt  .
there 's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would  , acts little of his will  .
god protects the king  , so traitors ca n't hurt him  .
tell me  , laertes  , why thou art thus incensed  .
tell me  , laertes  , why you 're so angry  .
let him go  , gertrude  .
gertrude  , let him go  .
speak  , man  .
tell me  , man  .
where is my father  ?
where 's my father  ?
dead  .
he 's dead  .
but not by him  .
but the king did n't kill him  .
let him demand his fill  .
let him ask what he wants to ask  .
how came he dead  ?
how did he end up dead  ?
i 'll not be juggled with  .
do n't mess with me  .
to hell  , allegiance  !
to hell with my vows of allegiance to you  !
vows  , to the blackest devil  !
vows can go to hell  !
conscience and grace  , to the profoundest pit  !
conscience  , too  !
i dare damnation  .
i do n't care if i 'm damned  .
to this point i stand that both the worlds i give to negligence  .
i do n't care what happens to me in this world or the next  .
let come what comes  , only i 'll be revenged most thoroughly for my father  .
whatever happens  , happens  , but i 'll get revenge for my father 's murder  .
who shall stay you  ?
who 's stopping you  ?
my will  , not all the world  .
only my free will nothing else  .
and for my means  , i 'll husband them so well  , they shall go far with little  .
what little means i have  , i 'll use against you  .
good laertes  , if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father 's death  , is 't writ in your revenge  , that  , swoopstake  , you will draw both friend and foe  , winner and loser  ?
my dear laertes  , in your eagerness to know the truth about your father 's death  , are you determined to hurt your father 's friends and enemies alike  ?
none but his enemies  .
no  , only his enemies  .
will you know them then  ?
do you want to know who they are  , then  ?
to his good friends thus wide i 'll ope my arms and  , like the kind life - rendering pelican  , repast them with my blood  .
i 'll open my arms wide to his true friends  , and like a mother with her brood  , i 'll even give my life for them  .
why  , now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman  .
why  , now you 're talking like a good son and a true gentleman  .
that i am guiltless of your father 's death and am most sensible in grief for it  , it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye  .
i 'll prove to you as clearly as daylight that i 'm innocent of your father 's death  , and am struck with grief over it  .
o heat  , dry up my brains  !
oh  , heat  , dry up my brains  !
tears seven times salt  , burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye  !
salty tears  , burn my eyes  !
by heaven  , thy madness shall be paid by weight  , till our scale turn the beam  .
by heaven  , i 'll get revenge for your madness  !
o rose of may  , dear maid  , kind sister  , sweet ophelia  !
oh  , you springtime rose  , dear maiden  , kind sister  , sweet ophelia  !
o heavens  , is 't possible a young maid 's wits should be as mortal as an old man 's life  ?
is it possible that a young woman 's mind could fade away as easily as an old man 's life  ?
nature is fine in love  , and where 't is fine  , it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves  .
human nature is refined and thoughtful person graciously gives a valuable part of herself away to her beloved  , as ophelia has sent off her sanity to her dead father  .
hadst thou thy wits  , and didst persuade revenge  , it could not move thus  .
if you were sane and could urge me to take revenge  , you could n't be more persuasive than you are now  .
this nothing 's more than matter  .
this nonsense means more than rational speech  .
thought and affliction  , passion  , hell itself  , she turns to favor and to prettiness  .
sadness and torment  , suffering  , hell itself she makes them almost pretty  .
do you see this  , o god  ?
do you see this  , oh  , god  ?
let this be so  .
all right  , then  .
his means of death  , his obscure funeral no trophy  , sword  , nor hatchment o'er his bones  , no noble rite nor formal ostentation cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth  , that i must call 't in question  .
the way he died  , his secret funeral  , no funeral rites or military display  , no noble rites or formal ceremony shout out from heaven and earth that i must call the way he died into question  .
so you shall  .
and you 're right to do so  .
and where the offense is  , let the great ax fall  .
may the guilty party be punished by death  .
i pray you  , go with me  .
please  , come with me  .
what are they that would speak with me  ?
who are the people who want to speak with me  ?
seafaring men  , sir  .
sailors  , sir  .
they say they have letters for you  .
they say they have letters for you  .
let them come in  .
show them in  .
i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted  , if not from lord hamlet  .
i do n't know who else would send me a letter from abroad except hamlet  .
let him bless thee too  .
may he bless you  , too  .
now must your conscience my acquaintance seal  , and you must put me in your heart for friend  , sith you have heard  , and with a knowing ear  , that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life  .
now you 've got to acknowledge my innocence and believe i 'm your friend  , since you 've heard and understood that the man who killed your father was trying to kill me  .
it well appears  .
it looks that way  .
but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats  , so criminal and so capital in nature  , as by your safety  , wisdom  , all things else  , you mainly were stirred up  .
but tell me why you did n't take immediate action against his criminal acts  , when your own safety and everything else would seem to call for it  .
and so have i a noble father lost  , a sister driven into desperate terms  , whose worth  , if praises may go back again  , stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections  .
and so i 've lost my noble father  , had my sister driven insane my sister who once was  ( if i can praise her for what she once was  , not what she is now  ) the most perfect girl who ever lived  .
but my revenge will come  .
but i 'll get my revenge  .

who brought them  ?

laertes  , you shall hear them  .
laertes  , i want you to hear what they say  .
leave us  .
leave us alone now  .
high and mighty  , you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom  .
high and mighty one  , you know i 've been set down naked  , you might say  , in your kingdom  .
tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes  , when i shall  , first asking your pardon thereunto  , recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return  .
tomorrow i 'll beg permission to look into your kingly eyes  , at which point i 'll tell you the story  ( after first apologizing  ) of how i came back to denmark so strangely and suddenly  .
hamlet  .
hamlet
what should this mean  ?
what does this mean  ?
are all the rest come back  ?
has everyone else come back too  ?
or is it some abuse  , and no such thing  ?
or is it all a lie and no one has yet returned  ?
know you the hand  ?
do you recognize the handwriting  ?
i 'm lost in it  , my lord  .
i have no clue  , my lord  .
but let him come  .
but let him come  .
it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth  , thus diddest thou  .
it warms my weary heart to think i 'll get the chance to look him in the eye and say  , you did this  .
ay  , my lord so you will not o'errule me to a peace  .
yes  , my lord  , as long as you wo n't lead me toward peace  .
to thine own peace  .
no  , just toward your own peace of mind  .
if he be now returned  , as checking at his voyage  , and that he means no more to undertake it  , i will work him to an exploit  , now ripe in my devise  , under the which he shall not choose but fall  .
if he 's come back to denmark without plans to continue on his trip  , then i 'll trick him into an undertaking  , which i 'm working out now  , that 's sure to kill him  .
and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe  , but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident  .
when he dies  , no one will be blamed  , even his mother will call it an accident  .
it falls right  .
that 'll be fine  .
you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet 's hearing for a quality wherein  , they say  , you shine  .
since you left  , people have been talking about and within earshot of hamlet a certain quality of yours in which  , they say  , you shine  .
your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one  , and that  , in my regard  , of the unworthiest siege  .
all your talents and gifts did n't arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did  , though to me it 's far from your best attribute  .
what part is that  , my lord  ?
what quality is that  , my lord  ?
a norman was 't  ?
hmm  , he was from normandy  , you say  ?
a norman  .
yes  , from normandy  .
upon my life  , lamond  !
i bet it was lamond  .
the very same  .
yes  , that 's the one  .
i know him well  .
i know him well  .
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation  .
he 's his homeland 's jewel  .
he made confession of you  , and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense  , and for your rapier most especially  , that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed if one could match you  .
he mentioned you to me  , giving you such high marks in fencing that he exclaimed it would be a miracle if someone could match you  .
the 'scrimers of their nation  , he swore  , had had neither motion  , guard  , nor eye  , if you opposed them  .
french fencers would n't be good enough for you  , he said  , since they do n't have the right moves or skills  .
sir  , this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er  , to play with him  .
hamlet was so jealous when he heard lamond 's report that he talked about nothing else but having you come over and play against him  .
now  , out of this
now  , the point is
what out of this  , my lord  ?
what 's the point  , my lord  ?
laertes  , was your father dear to you  ?
laertes  , did you love your father  ?
or are you like the painting of a sorrow  , a face without a heart  ?
or is your grief just an illusion a mere painting of sorrow  ?
why ask you this  ?
how could you ask  ?
to cut his throat i ' th ' church  .
i 'll cut hamlet 's throat in church  .
one woe doth tread upon another 's heel  , so fast they follow  .
the bad news just keeps on coming  , one disaster after another  .
your sister 's drowned  , laertes  .
your sister 's drowned  , laertes  .
drowned  ?
drowned  ?
oh  , where  ?
oh  , where  ?
there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream  .
there 's a willow that leans over the brook  , dangling its white leaves over the glassy water  .
there with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers  , nettles  , daisies  , and long purples  , that liberal shepherds give a grosser name  , but our cold maids do dead men 's fingers call them  .
ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves  , braiding in crowflowers  , thistles  , daisies  , and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for  , but which pure - minded girls call dead men 's fingers  .
there  , on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang  , an envious sliver broke  , when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook  .
climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches  , she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook  .
her clothes spread wide  , and mermaid - like a while they bore her up  , which time she chanted snatches of old lauds as one incapable of her own distress  , or like a creature native and indued unto that element  .
her clothes spread out wide in the water  , and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns  , acting like someone who does n't realize the danger she 's in  , or like someone completely accustomed to danger  .
but long it could not be till that her garments  , heavy with their drink  , pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death  .
but it was only a matter of time before her clothes  , heavy with the water they absorbed  , pulled the poor thing out of her song  , down into the mud at the bottom of the brook  .
alas  , then she is drowned  .
so she is drowned  .
drowned  , drowned  .
drowned  , drowned  .
too much of water hast thou  , poor ophelia  , and therefore i forbid my tears  .
you 've had too much water already  , poor ophelia  , so i wo n't shed watery tears for you  .
but yet it is our trick  .
but crying is what humans do  .
nature her custom holds  , let shame say what it will  .
we do what 's in our nature  , even if we 're ashamed of it  .
when these are gone  , the woman will be out  .
after i stop crying i 'll be through acting like a woman  .
adieu  , my lord  .
good - bye  , my lord  .
i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze  , but that this folly doubts it  .
i have some fiery words i could speak now  , but my foolish tears are drowning them out  .
is she to be buried in christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation  ?
are they really going to give her a christian burial
i tell thee she is  .
i 'm telling you  , yes  .
therefore make her grave straight  .
so finish that grave right away  .
the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial  .
the coroner examined her case and says it should be a christian funeral  .
how can that be  , unless she drowned herself in her own defense  ?
but how  , unless she drowned in self - defense  ?
why  , 't is found so  .
that 's what they 're saying she did  .
nay  , but hear you  , goodman delver
no  , listen here  , gravedigger sir
but is this law  ?
is that how the law sees it  ?
ay  , marry  , is 't  .
it sure is  .
crowner 's quest law  .
the coroner 's inquest law  .
will you ha ' the truth on 't  ?
do you want to know the truth  ?
if this had not been a gentlewoman  , she should have been buried out o ' christian burial  .
if this woman had n't been rich  , she would n't have been given a christian burial  .
why  , there thou sayst  .
well there  , now you 've said it  .
and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian  .
it 's a pity that the rich have more freedom to hang or drown themselves than the rest of us christians  .
come  , my spade  .
come on  , shovel  .
there is no ancient gentleman but gardeners  , ditchers  , and grave - makers  .

what is he that builds stronger than either the mason  , the shipwright  , or the carpenter  ?
what do you call a person who builds stronger things than a stonemason  , a shipbuilder  , or a carpenter does  ?
the gallows - maker  , for that frame outlives a thousand tenants  .
the one who builds the gallows to hang people on  , since his structure outlives a thousand inhabitants  .
now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church  .
now  , it 's wrong to say that the gallows are stronger than a church  .
argal  , the gallows may do well to thee  .
therefore  , the gallows may do some good  .
to 't again  , come  .
come on  , your turn  .
who builds stronger than a mason  , a shipwright  , or a carpenter  ?
let 's see  , who builds stronger things than a stonemason  , a shipbuilder  , or a carpenter  ?
ay  , tell me that  , and unyoke  .
that 's the question  , so answer it  .
marry  , now i can tell  .
ah  , i 've got it  !

cudgel thy brains no more about it  , for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating  .

and when you are asked this question next  , say a grave - maker  .

the houses that he makes last till doomsday  .
the next time someone asks you this riddle  , say a gravedigger  .
go  , get thee in  .
the houses he makes last till judgment day  .

now go and get me some booze  .

does n't this guy realize what he 's doing  ?
he sings at grave - making  .
he 's singing while digging a grave  .
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness  .
he 's gotten so used to graves that they do n't bother him anymore  .
't is e'en so  .
yes  , exactly  .
the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense  .
only people who do n't have to work can afford to be sensitive  .

it might  , my lord  .
indeed  , my lord  .
or of a courtier  , which could say  , good morrow  , sweet lord  !
or a courtier  , who could say things like  , good night  , my sweet lord  !
how dost thou  , good lord  ?
how are you doing  , good lord  ?
this might be my lord such - a - one that praised my lord such - a - one 's horse when he meant to beg it  , might it not  ?
this might be the skull of lord so - and - so  , who praised lord such - and - such 's horse when he wanted to borrow it  , right  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
why  , e'en so  .
exactly  .
and now my lady worm 's  , chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton 's spade  .

did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them  ?

not a jot more  , my lord  .
no more than that  , my lord  .
is not parchment made of sheepskins  ?
is n't the parchment of a legal document made of sheepskin  ?
ay  , my lord  , and of calfskins too  .
yes  , my lord  , and calfskin too  .
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that  .
anyone who puts his trust in such documents is a sheep or a calf  .
i will speak to this fellow  .
i 'll talk to this guy  .
whose grave 's this  , sirrah  ?
excuse me  , sir  , whose grave is this  ?
mine  , sir  .
it 's mine  , sir  .
 .
 .
i think it be thine  , indeed  , for thou liest in 't  .
i think it really must be yours  , since you 're the one lying in it  .
you lie out on 't  , sir  , and therefore it is not yours  .
and you 're lying outside of it  , so it 's not yours  .
for my part  , i do not lie in 't  , and yet it is mine  .
as for me  , i 'm not lying to you in it it 's really mine  .
thou dost lie in 't  , to be in 't and say it is thine  .
but you lying in it  , being in it and saying it 's yours  .
't is for the dead  , not for the quick  .
it 's for the dead  , not the living  .
therefore thou liest  .
so you 're lying  .

for no man  , sir  .
for no man  , sir  .
what woman  , then  ?
what woman  , then  ?
for none  , neither  .
for no woman  , either  .
who is to be buried in 't  ?
who 's to be buried in it  ?
one that was a woman  , sir  , but  , rest her soul  , she 's dead  .
one who used to be a woman but bless her soul is dead now  .
how absolute the knave is  !
how literal this guy is  !
we must speak by the card  , or equivocation will undo us  .
we have to speak precisely  , or he 'll get the better of us with his wordplay  .
by the lord  , horatio  , these three years i have taken a note of it  .
lord  , horatio  , i 've been noticing this for a few years now  .
the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe  .
the peasants have become so clever and witty that they 're nipping at the heels of noblemen  .
how long hast thou been a grave - maker  ?
how long have you been a gravedigger  ?
of all the days i ' the year  , i came to 't that day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras  .
of all the days in the year  , i started the day that the late king hamlet defeated fortinbras  .
how long is that since  ?
how long ago was that  ?
ay  , marry  , why was he sent into england  ?
why was he sent to england  ?
why  ?
why not  ?
'twill not be seen in him there  .
because nobody will notice he 's crazy  .
there the men are as mad as he  .
everyone there is as crazy as he is  .
how came he mad  ?
how did he go crazy  ?
very strangely  , they say  .
in a strange way  , they say  .
how strangely  ?
what do you mean  , in a strange way  ?
faith  , e'en with losing his wits  .
by losing his mind  .
upon what ground  ?
on what grounds  ?
why  , here in denmark  .
right here in denmark  .
i have been sexton here  , man and boy  , thirty years  .
i 've been the church warden here for thirty years  , since childhood  .
how long will a man lie i ' the earth ere he rot  ?
how long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot  ?
faith  , if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year  .
well  , if he 's not rotten before he dies  ( and there are a lot of people now who are so rotten they start falling to pieces even before you put them in the coffin  )  , he 'll last eight or nine years  .
a tanner will last you nine year  .
a leathermaker will last nine years  .
why he more than another  ?
why does he last longer  ?
whose was it  ?
whose was it  ?
a whoreson mad fellow 's it was  .
a crazy bastard  .
whose do you think it was  ?
who do you think  ?
nay  , i know not  .
i really do n't know  .
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue  !
damn that crazy madman  !
he poured a flagon of rhenish on my head once  .
he poured a pitcher of white wine on my head once  .
this same skull  , sir  , was yorick 's skull  , the king 's jester  .
this is the skull of yorick  , the king 's jester  .
this  ?
this one  ?
e'en that  .
yes  , that one  .
let me see  .
let me see  .
alas  , poor yorick  !
oh  , poor yorick  !
i knew him  , horatio  , a fellow of infinite jest  , of most excellent fancy  .
i used to know him  , horatio a very funny guy  , and with an excellent imagination  .
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times  , and now  , how abhorred in my imagination it is  !
he carried me on his back a thousand times  , and now how terrible this is him  .
my gorge rises at it  .
it makes my stomach turn  .
here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft  .
i do n't know how many times i kissed the lips that used to be right here  .
where be your gibes now  ?
where are your jokes now  ?
your gambols  ?
your pranks  ?
your songs  ?
your songs  ?
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar  ?
your flashes of wit that used to set the whole table laughing  ?
not one now to mock your own grinning  ?
you do n't make anybody smile now  .
quite chapfallen  ?
are you sad about that  ?
now get you to my lady 's chamber and tell her  , let her paint an inch thick  , to this favor she must come  .
you need to go to my lady 's room and tell her that no matter how much makeup she slathers on  , she 'll end up just like you some day  .
make her laugh at that  .
that 'll make her laugh  .
prithee  , horatio  , tell me one thing  .
horatio  , tell me something  .
what 's that  , my lord  ?
what 's that  , my lord  ?
dost thou think alexander looked o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth  ?
do you think alexander the great looked like this when he was buried  ?
e'en so  .
exactly like that  .
and smelt so  ?
and smelled like that  , too  ?
pah  !
whew  !
e'en so  , my lord  .
just as bad  , my lord  .
to what base uses we may return  , horatio  .
how low we can fall  , horatio  .
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole  ?
is n't it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of alexander the great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel  ?
'twere to consider too curiously  , to consider so  .
if you thought that you 'd be thinking too much  .
what ceremony else  ?
what other rites are you going to give her  ?
what ceremony else  ?
what other rites are you going to give her  ?
her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warranty  .
i 've performed as many rites as i 'm permitted  .
her death was doubtful  , and  , but that great command o'ersways the order  , she should in ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet  .
her death was suspicious  , and were it not for the fact that the king gave orders to bury her here  , she 'd have been buried outside the church graveyard  .
for charitable prayers shards  , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her  .
she deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body  .
yet here she is allowed her virgin crants  , her maiden strewments  , and the bringing home of bell and burial  .
but she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin  , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her  .
must there no more be done  ?
is n't there any other rite you can perform  ?
no more be done  .
no  , nothing  .
we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace - parted souls  .
we would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them  .
lay her i ' th ' earth  , and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring  !
lay her in the ground  , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh  !
i tell thee  , churlish priest  , a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling  .
i 'm telling you  , you jerk priest  , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you 're howling in hell  .
horatio what  , the fair ophelia  ?
horatio what  , the beautiful ophelia  ?
sweets to the sweet  .
sweet flowers for a sweet girl  .
farewell  !
goodbye  !
i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet 's wife  .
i once hoped you 'd be my hamlet 's wife  .
i thought thy bride - bed to have decked  , sweet maid  , and not have strewed thy grave  .
i thought i 'd be tossing flowers on your wedding bed  , my sweet girl  , not on your grave  .
oh  , treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursd head  , whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of  !
oh  , damn three times  , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind  .
hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms  .
hold off burying her until i 've caught her in my arms once more  .
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead  , till of this flat a mountain you have made  , t ' o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus  .
now pile the dirt onto the living and the dead alike  , till you 've made a mountain higher than  .
what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis  , whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars  , and makes them stand like wonder - wounded hearers  ?
who is the one whose grief is so loud and clear  , whose words of sadness make the planets stand still in the heavens as if they 've been hurt by what they 've heard  ?
this is i  , hamlet the dane  .
it 's me  , hamlet the dane  .
the devil take thy soul  !
to hell with your soul  !
pluck them asunder  .
pull them apart  .

gentlemen  !
hamlet good my lord  , be quiet  .
hamlet please  , my lord  , calm down  .
why  , i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag  .
i 'll fight him over this issue till i do n't have the strength to blink  .
o my son  , what theme  ?
oh  , my son  , what issue is that  ?
i loved ophelia  .
i loved ophelia  .
forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum  .
forty thousand brothers  , if you added all their love together  , could n't match mine  .
what wilt thou do for her  ?
what are you going to do for her  ?
o  , he is mad  , laertes  .
oh  , he 's crazy  , laertes  !
for love of god  , forbear him  .
for the love of god  , be patient with him  .
this is mere madness  .
this is pure insanity  .
and thus a while the fit will work on him  .
he 'll be like this for a little while  .
anon  , as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed  , his silence will sit drooping  .
then he 'll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch  .
i pray thee  , good horatio  , wait upon him  .
please  , horatio  , go with him  .
laertes strengthen your patience in our last night 's speech  .
laertes do n't forget our talk last night  , and try to be patient  .
we 'll put the matter to the present push  .
we 'll take care of this problem soon  .
good gertrude  , set some watch over your son  .
gertrude  , have the guards keep an eye on your son  .
this grave shall have a living monument  .
a monument shall be built for ophelia that will last forever  , i promise  .
an hour of quiet shortly shall we see  .
we 'll have the quiet we need soon  .
till then in patience our proceeding be  .
in the meantime  , let 's proceed patiently  .
so much for this  , sir  .
that 's enough about that  .
now shall you see the other  .
now i 'll tell you the other story about my journey  .
you do remember all the circumstance  ?
do you remember the circumstances  ?
remember it  , my lord  ?
how could i forget  , my lord  !
that is most certain  .
well  , of course  .
up from my cabin  , my sea - gown scarfed about me  , in the dark groped i to find out them  , had my desire  , fingered their packet  , and in fine withdrew to mine own room again  , making so bold  ( my fears forgetting manners  ) to unseal their grand commission  , where i found  , horatio o royal knavery  !
so i came up from my cabin with my robe tied around me  , groped in the dark to find what i was looking for  , found it  , looked through their packet of papers  , and returned to my cabin again  .
an exact command  , larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark 's health  , and england 's too  , with ho  !
i was bold enough  ( i guess my fears made me forget my manners  ) to open the document containing the king 's instructions  .
such bugs and goblins in my life that  , on the supervise  ( no leisure bated  , no  , not to stay the grinding of the ax  ) my head should be struck off  .
and there i found  , horatio  , such royal mischief a precisely worded order  , sugared with lots of talk about denmark 's well - being and england 's too  , to cut off my head  , without even waiting to sharpen the ax  .
is 't possible  ?
is it possible  ?
horatio here 's the commission  .
horatio here 's the document  .
read it at more leisure  .
read it in your free time  .
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed  ?
but do you want to hear what i did then  ?
i beseech you  .
yes  , please tell me  .
ay  , good my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
an earnest conjuration from the king  , as england was his faithful tributary  , as love between them like the palm might flourish  , as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities  , and many suchlike as 's of great charge  , that  , on the view and knowing of these contents  , without debatement further  , more or less  , he should the bearers put to sudden death  , not shriving time allowed  .
a sincere plea from the king  , who commands the respect of england  , and who hopes that the love between the two countries can flourish  , and that peace can join them in friendship and other fancy mumbo jumbo like that saying that  , once they read this document  , without any debate  , the ones delivering the letter should be put to death immediately  , without giving them time to confess to a priest  .
how was this sealed  ?
but how could you put an official seal on it  ?
why  , even in that was heaven ordinant  .
heaven helped me out with that too  .
i had my father 's signet in my purse  , which was the model of that danish seal  .
i had my father 's signet ring in my pocket  , with the royal seal of denmark on it  .
folded the writ up in form of th ' other  , subscribed it  , gave 't th ' impression  , placed it safely  , the changeling never known  .
i folded up the new document  , signed it  , sealed it  , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference  .
now  , the next day was our sea fight  , and what to this was sequent thou know'st already  .
the next day we had our fight at sea  , and you know what happened after that  .
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to 't  .
so rosencrantz and guildenstern are in for it  .
why  , man  , they did make love to this employment  .
man  , they were asking for it  .
they are not near my conscience  .
i do n't feel guilty about them at all  .
their defeat does by their own insinuation grow  .
they got what they deserved  .
't is dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensd points of mighty opposites  .
it 's always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents  .
why  , what a king is this  !
what a king claudius is  !
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there  .
he 'll find out soon what happened in england  .
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark  .
welcome back to denmark  , my lord  .
i humbly thank you  , sir  .
thank you kindly  , sir  .
horatio dost know this water - fly  ?
horatio do you know this insect  ?
hamlet no  , my good lord  .
hamlet no  , my lord  .
horatio thy state is the more gracious  , for 't is a vice to know him  .
horatio you 're lucky  , since knowing him is most unpleasant  .
he hath much land  , and fertile  .
he owns a lot of good land  .
let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king 's mess  .
give an animal a lot of money  , and he 'll be welcome at the king 's table  .
't is a chough  , but  , as i say  , spacious in the possession of dirt  .
he 's a jerk  , but he owns a whole lot of dirt  , so he 's treated well  .
sweet lord  , if your lordship were at leisure  , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty  .
my lord  , if you have a free moment  , i have a message from his majesty  .
i thank your lordship  .
no thank you  , my lord  .
it is very hot  .
it 's very hot  .
it is indifferent cold  , my lord  , indeed  .
it is rather cold  , indeed  , my lord  .
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion  .
and yet i feel it 's very hot and humid  , which is bad for my complexion  .
exceedingly  , my lord  .
yes indeed it is  , sir  .
it is very sultry as 'twere i can not tell how  .
very humid  , i ca n't tell you how humid it is  .
my lord  , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head  .
my lord  , his majesty wanted me to tell you that he 's placed a large bet on you  .
sir  , this is the matter
this is what it 's all about
i beseech you  , remember osric
please  , i beg you osric
sir  , his definement suffers no perdition in you  , though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th ' arithmetic of memory  , and yet but yaw neither  , in respect of his quick sail  .
sir  , your description of him does n't detract from his good qualities  , though i know that trying to list them all would make your head spin  , and even so you would n't be able to keep up with him  .
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him  .
you speak absolutely correctly  , sir  .
the concernancy  , sir  ?
and what 's the point  , sir  ?
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath  ?
why are we talking about him like this  ?
sir  ?
sorry  , sir  ?
what imports the nomination of this gentleman  ?
osric what is the significance of referring to this individual  ?
of laertes  ?
laertes  , you mean  ?
of him  , sir  .
yes  , laertes  , sir  .
i know you are not ignorant
i know you know something
i would you did  , sir  .
thanks for the compliment  , i 'm happy you know that  .
yet in faith  , if you did  , it would not much approve me  .
but in fact it does n't say much  .
well  , sir  ?
i 'm sorry  , you were saying  ?
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
i know you know something about how excellent laertes is
i mean  , sir  , for his weapon  .
excellent in fencing  , i mean  , sir  .
but in the imputation laid on him by them  , in his meed he 's unfellowed  .
his reputation in fencing is unrivaled  .
what 's his weapon  ?
what kind of weapon does he use  ?
rapier and dagger  .
the rapier and the dagger  .
that 's two of his weapons  .
those are only two of his weapons  .
but well  .
but  , go on  .
the king  , sir  , hath wagered with him six barbary horses  , against the which he has impawned  , as i take it  , six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle  , hangers  , and so  .
the king has bet six barbary horses  , and he has prepared six french rapiers and daggers with all their accessories  .
three of the carriages  , in faith  , are very dear to fancy  , very responsive to the hilts  , most delicate carriages  , and of very liberal conceit  .
three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed  , and they match the fencing accessories  .
what call you the carriages  ?
what do you mean by carriages  ?
hamlet i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done  .
hamlet i knew you 'd have to look something up in the dictionary before we were finished  .
the carriages  , sir  , are the hangers  .
the carriages  , sir  , are the hangers where the swords hang  .
the king  , sir  , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him  , he shall not exceed you three hits  .
the king  , sir  , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and laertes  , he wo n't beat you by more than three hits  .
he hath laid on twelve for nine  , and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer  .
you could get started immediately if you 'll give me your answer  .
how if i answer no  ?
but what if my answer 's no  ?
i mean  , my lord  , the opposition of your person in trial  .
i mean  , if you 'd agree to play against laertes  , sir  .
sir  , i will walk here in the hall  .
sir  , i 'm going to go for a walk in the hall here whether the king likes it or not  .
if it please his majesty  , 't is the breathing time of day with me  .
it 's my exercise time  .
let the foils be brought  , the gentleman willing  , and the king hold his purpose  .
bring in the swords  , if the king still wants to go through with it and if laertes is still willing  .
i will win for him an i can  .
i 'll have the king win his bet if i can  .
if not  , i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits  .
if not  , i 'll only have suffered some embarrassment and a few sword hits  .
shall i redeliver you e'en so  ?
shall i quote you in those exact words  , sir  ?
to this effect  , sir  , after what flourish your nature will  .
just get the point across  , however flowery you want to be  .
i commend my duty to your lordship  .
my services are at your command  .
yours  , yours  .
thank you  .
he does well to commend it himself  .
it 's a good thing he 's here to recommend himself  .
there are no tongues else for 's turn  .
no one else would  .
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head  .
that crazy bird 's only half - hatched  .
my lord  , his majesty commended him to you by young osric  , who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall  .
my lord  , osric has told the king about your agreeing to the fencing match  .
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes  , or that you will take longer time  .
the king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away  , or wait awhile  .
i am constant to my purpose  .
i 'll do whatever the king wants  .
they follow the king 's pleasure  .
if he 's ready now  , so am i .
if his fitness speaks  , mine is ready  , now or whensoever  , provided i be so able as now  .
otherwise  , i 'll do it anytime  , as long as i 'm able  .
the king and queen and all are coming down  .
the king and queen are coming down with everyone else  .
in happy time  .
right on cue  .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play  .
the queen wants you to chat with laertes politely before you begin your match  .
she well instructs me  .
she 's full of good advice  .
you will lose this wager  , my lord  .
you 're going to lose this bet  , my lord  .
i do not think so  .
i do n't think so  .
since he went into france  , i have been in continual practice  .
i 've been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to france  .
i shall win at the odds  .
with the handicap they 've given me  , i think i 'll win  .
but thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart  .
but i have a sinking feeling anyway  .
but it is no matter  .
oh well  .
nay  , good my lord
wait  , my lord
it is but foolery  , but it is such a kind of gain - giving as would perhaps trouble a woman  .
i know i 'm being foolish  , but i have the kind of vague misgiving women often get  .
if your mind dislike anything  , obey it  .
if something is telling you not to play  , listen to it  .
i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit  .
i 'll say you 're not feeling well  .
come  , hamlet  , come  , and take this hand from me  .
come shake hands with laertes  , hamlet  .
laertes ' hamlet '
( claudius laertes ' hamlet 's  )
come  , one for me  .
yes  , hand me one too  .
i 'll be your foil  , laertes  .
i 'm going to make you look sharp  , laertes  .
in mine ignorance your skill shall  , like a star i ' th ' darkest night  , stick fiery off indeed  .
i 'm so bad at the game that your skill will shine like the brightest star in the darkest night  .
you mock me  , sir  .
you 're making fun of me  .
no  , by this hand  .
no  , i swear i 'm not  .
give them the foils  , young osric  .
give them the swords  , osric  .
cousin hamlet  , you know the wager  ?
hamlet  , you know the bet  ?
very well  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  , quite well  .
your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side  .
you 've bet on the weaker fencer  .
this is too heavy  .
this sword 's too heavy  .
let me see another  .
show me another one  .
this likes me well  .
i like this one  .
these foils have all a length  ?
are they all the same length  ?
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
set me the stoups of wine upon that table  .
put the goblets of wine on that table  .
if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange  , let all the battlements their ordnance fire  !
if hamlet makes the first or second hit  , or gets back at laertes by making the third hit  , then let my soldiers give him a military salute  .
the king shall drink to hamlet 's better breath  , and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark 's crown have worn  .
i 'll drink to hamlet 's health  , and into his goblet i 'll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four danish kings  .
give me the cups  .
give me the goblets  .
and let the kettle to the trumpet speak  , the trumpet to the cannoneer without  , the cannons to the heavens  , the heavens to earth  , now the king dunks to hamlet  .
and now let the drum and the trumpet play  , and the trumpet signal the cannon outside to fire  , and let the cannon tell the heavens  , and the heavens tell all the earth that the king is drinking now to hamlet 's health  .
come  , begin  .

he 's fat  , and scant of breath  .
he 's flabby and out of breath  .
here  , hamlet  , take my napkin  , rub thy brows  .

but i almost feel guilty  .

you 're just playing around  .
i pray you  , pass with your best violence  .

they 're overdoing it  .
nay  , come  , again  .
no  , come on  , one more time  .
look to the queen there  , ho  !
take care of the queen  !
how is 't  , laertes  ?
how do you feel  , laertes  ?
why  , as a woodcock to mine own springe  , osric  .
like a mouse caught in my own trap  , osric  .
i am justly killed with mine own treachery  .
(  ) i 've been killed by my own evil tricks  .
how does the queen  ?
how 's the queen  ?
she swoons to see them bleed  .
she fainted at the sight of them bleeding  .
no  , no  , the drink  , the drink  !
no  , no  , the drink  , the drink  !
o my dear hamlet  !
oh  , my dear hamlet  !
the drink  , the drink  !

it is here  , hamlet  .
i 'm the one  , hamlet  .
hamlet  , thou art slain  .
hamlet  , you 're dead  .
no medicine in the world can do thee good  .
no medicine in the world can cure you  .
in thee there is not half an hour of life  .
you do n't have more than half an hour to live  .
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand  , unbated and envenomed  .
the treacherous weapon is right in your hand  , sharp and dipped in poison  .
the foul practice hath turned itself on me  .
the foul plan backfired on me  .
lo  , here i lie  , never to rise again  .
here i lie and will never get up again  .
thy mother 's poisoned  .
your mother 's been poisoned  .

he is justly served  .

it is a poison tempered by himself  .
he mixed that poison himself  .
exchange forgiveness with me  , noble hamlet  .
please forgive me as i forgive you  , hamlet  .
mine and my father 's death come not upon thee  , nor thine on me  .
you 're not responsible for my death and my father 's  , and i 'm not responsible for yours  .
never believe it  .
not for a second  .
i am more an antique roman than a dane  .

as thou'rt a man  , give me the cup  .
please  , give me that goblet  , if you love me  .
let go  !

horatio o god  , horatio  , what a wounded name  , things standing thus unknown  , shall live behind me  !
oh god  , horatio  , what a damaged reputation i 'm leaving behind me  , as no one knows the truth  .
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity a while  , and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story  .
if you ever loved me  , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile  , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story  .
what warlike noise is this  ?
what are these warlike noises  ?
young fortinbras  , with conquest come from poland  , to th ' ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley  .
young fortinbras  , returning in triumph from poland  , is firing his guns to greet the english ambassadors  .
where is this sight  ?
what do i see here  ?
what is it ye would see  ?
what would you like to see  ?
if aught of woe or wonder  , cease your search  .
if it 's a tragedy  , you 've come to the right place  .
this quarry cries on havoc  .
these corpses suggest mayhem  .
o proud death  , what feast is toward in thine eternal cell  , that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck  ?
oh  , proud death  , what banquet are you preparing that you 've needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke  ?
claudius not from his mouth  , had it th ' ability of life to thank you  .
claudius not the king  , even if he were still alive to thank you  .
he never gave commandment for their death  .
he never ordered their deaths  .
but since so jump upon this bloody question  , you from the polack wars  , and you from england  , are here arrived  , give order that these bodies high on a stage be placd to the view  , and let me speak to th ' yet - unknowing world how these things came about  .
but since you 've come so soon after this bloodbath  , you from battles in poland and you from england  , then give your men orders to display these corpses on a high platform  , and let me tell the world how all this happened .
so shall you hear of carnal  , bloody  , and unnatural acts  , of accidental judgments  , casual slaughters  , of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause  , and  , in this upshot  , purposes mistook fall'n on th ' inventors ' heads  .
you 'll hear of violent and unnatural acts  , terrible accidents  , casual murders  , deaths caused by trickery and by threat  , and finally murderous plans that backfired on their perpetrators  .
all this can i truly deliver  .
all this i can explain  .
let us haste to hear it  , and call the noblest to the audience  .
let 's hear about it right away and invite all the noblemen to listen  .
for me  , with sorrow i embrace my fortune  .
as for me  , i welcome my good luck with sadness  .
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom  , which now to claim my vantage doth invite me  .
i have some rights to claim this kingdom  , and by arriving at this moment i have an opportunity to put them into effect  .
of that i shall have also cause to speak  , and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more  .
i also have a few things to say about that  , which hamlet just told me  .
but let this same be presently performed  , even while men 's minds are wild  , lest more mischance on plots and errors happen  .
but let 's get down to business even though people are in a frenzy of grief to avoid any further plots and mishaps  .
but how  , my lord  , shall we resist it now  ?
but how will we keep it from being passed now  , my lord  ?
this would drink deep  .
that would be quite a drain  .
'twould drink the cup and all  .
it would drain us dry  .
but what prevention  ?
but what can be done to prevent it  ?
the king is full of grace and fair regard  .
the king is virtuous and kind  .
and a true lover of the holy church  .
and a true lover of the holy church  .
we are blessd in the change  .
we are fortunate in the change  .
it must be so  , for miracles are ceased  , and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected  .
that must be it  , because the age of miracles is passed  , and we have to find reasonable explanations for why these things happen  .
how did this offer seem received  , my lord  ?
how did he take the offer  , my lord  ?
with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear  , as i perceived his grace would fain have done  , the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms  , and generally to the crown and seat of france  , derived from edward  , his great - grandfather  .
favorably  , except that there was n't enough time for his grace to hear  , as i sensed he would have liked to  , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in france  , and to the throne of france in general  , through clear lines of descent originating with his great - grandfather  , edward iii  .
what was th ' impediment that broke this off  ?
what kept you from telling him this  ?
the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience  .
the french ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king  .
and the hour  , i think  , is come to give him hearing  .
and  , in fact  , i think they 're meeting together right now  .
is it four o'clock  ?
is it four o'clock  ?
it is  .
it is  .
then go we in to know his embassy  , which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it  .
then let 's go in and hear what he has to say though i think i can guess before the frenchman has uttered a word  .
where is my gracious lord of canterbury  ?
where is my gracious lord of canterbury  ?
not here in presence  .
he 's not here  .
send for him  , good uncle  .
send for him  , dear uncle  .
shall we call in th ' ambassador  , my liege  ?
shall we call in the ambassador  , my liege  ?
not yet  , my cousin  .
not yet  , cousin  .
we would be resolved  , before we hear him  , of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france  .
before i hear him  , i want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and france  .
god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it  .
may god and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time  .
may i with right and conscience make this claim  ?
can i justifiably and in good conscience make this claim  ?
your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood  .
the other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive  , just like your lion - hearted forebears  .
we must not only arm t ' invade the french  , but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot  , who will make road upon us with all advantages  .
we must not only arm ourselves to invade france  , but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the scots  , who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack  .
they of those marches  , gracious sovereign  , shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers  .
your subjects in the north  , gracious sovereign  , will provide a wall of defense against scottish thieves across the border  .
but there 's a saying very old and true  : if that you will france win  , then with scotland first begin  .
but here 's an old  , true saying  : if you want to win france  , start with scotland  .
for once the eagle england being in prey  , to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs  , playing the mouse in absence of the cat  , to 'tame and havoc more than she can eat  .
for when the eagle england leaves her nest to seek prey  , the weasel scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and  , like the mouse when the cat 's away  , destroy more than she can actually eat  .
it follows  , then  , the cat must stay at home  .
it would follow from this that the cat should stay home  .
yet that is but a crushed necessity  , since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves  .
but that is a false conclusion  , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves  .
while that the armd hand doth fight abroad  , th ' advisd head defends itself at home  .
while the armed hand fights in foreign lands  , the wise head defends itself at home  .
for government  , though high and low and lower  , put into parts  , doth keep in one consent  , congreeing in a full and natural close  , like music  .
for though the state is divided into different levels and functions  , it all works in agreement for a unified purpose  , a natural and perfect end such as we find in music  .
if we  , with thrice such powers left at home  , can not defend our own doors from the dog  , let us be worried  , and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy  .
if we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home  , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation  .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin  .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin  .
now are we well resolved  , and by god 's help and yours  , the noble sinews of our power  , france being ours  , we 'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces  .
now i 've made up my mind  , and with god 's help and yours  , you nobles who are the mainstay of my power i 'll force france to fear me  , or i 'll break her into pieces  , as she 's rightfully mine  .
or there we 'll sit  , ruling in large and ample empery o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms  , or lay these bones in an unworthy urn  , tombless  , with no remembrance over them  .
either i 'll sit  , ruling with absolute authority over france and all her dukedoms  , or i 'll lay these bones in a common grave  , with no stone or inscription over them  .
either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts  , or else our grave  , like turkish mute  , shall have a tongueless mouth  , not worshipped with a waxen epitaph  .
either the story of my deeds will be declaimed loudly and without restraint  , or else my grave will remain speechless  , like a turkish mute  , not honored with even an epitaph etched in wax  .
now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin  , for we hear your greeting is from him  , not from the king  .
i 'm ready now to hear what my good cousin the dauphin has to say for i hear that the greeting you bear is from him  , not the king  .
we are no tyrant  , but a christian king  , unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons  .
i am no tyrant but a christian king  , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons  .
therefore with frank and with uncurbd plainness tell us the dauphin 's mind  .
therefore tell me the dauphin 's mind frankly and without constraint  .
what treasure  , uncle  ?
what 's the treasure  , uncle  ?
tennis balls  , my liege  .
tennis balls  , my liege  .
this was a merry message  .
that was a humorous message  .
ere he take ship for france  , and in southampton  .
shifts  , friends  , to southampton  .
linger your patience on  , and we 'll digest th ' abuse of distance  , force a play  .
that 's where you must pretend the theater is  ; that 's where you must sit  .
the sum is paid  , the traitors are agreed  , the king is set from london  , and the scene is now transported  , gentles  , to southampton  .
from there we 'll safely carry you to france and back  , calming the waters of the channel to provide you with a smooth voyage  .
there is the playhouse now  , there must you sit  , and thence to france shall we convey you safe and bring you back  , charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass  ; for  , if we may  , we 'll not offend one stomach with our play  .
for if we can help it  , we 'd just as soon nobody was made sick by our play  .
but  , till the king come forth  , and not till then  , unto southampton do we shift our scene  .
but we wo n't shift the scene to southampton until henry reappears  .
well met  , corporal nym  .

tell me  , are you and ensign pistol friends again yet  ?
faith  , i will live so long as i may  , that 's the certain of it  .
well  , i will live until i die  , that 's for sure  , and when i ca n't live anymore  , i 'll deal with it  .
and when i can not live any longer  , i will do as i may  .

lovely  , most lovely katherine  , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love - suit to a gentle heart like yours  ?
your majesty shall mock at me  .
your majesty shall mock at me  .
i can not speak your england  .
i can not speak your england  .
o fair katherine  , if you will love me soundly with your french heart  , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue  .
lovely katherine  , if you will love me well with your french heart  , i 'm happy to hear you confess it in broken english  .
do you like me  , kate  ?
do you like me  , kate  ?
i can not tell what is like me  .
pardon me but i do not know what is like me  .
an angel is like you  , kate  , and you are like an angel  .
an angel is like you  , kate  , and you are like an angel  .
i said so  , dear katherine  ; and i must not blush to affirm it  .
i said so  , dear katherine  , and i 'm not ashamed to repeat it  .
what says she  , fair one  ?
 ( alice  ) what does she say  , pretty one  ?
that the tongues of men are full of deceits  ?
that the tongues of men are full of deceits  ?
oui  , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits  ; dat is de princess  .
 , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits  : dere 's de princess for you  .
the princess is the better englishwoman  .
how very english of her  .
i ' faith  , kate  , my wooing is fit for thy understanding  .
kate  , my wooing is fit for your understanding  : i am glad your english is n't better  .
i am glad thou canst speak no better english  , for if thou couldst  , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown  .
if it were  , you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think i 'd sold my farm to buy my crown  .
i know no ways to mince it in love  , but directly to say  , i love you  .
i do n't know any fancy ways of talking about love  , only to say right out  , i love you  .
then if you urge me farther than to say  , do you  , in faith  ?
if you press me any further than with the question  , do you really  ?
i wear out my suit  .
my love scene is over  .
give me your answer  , i ' faith  , do  ; and so clap hands and a bargain  .
so give me your answer  , and we 'll shake on it  .
how say you  , lady  ?
deal  ?
me understand vell  .
with all due respect  , me understand well  .
marry  , if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake  , kate  , why you undid me  .
really  , if you were thinking of having me write poetry or dance for you  , kate  , you 've defeated me already  .
for the one  , i have neither words nor measure  ; and for the other  , i have no strength in measure  , yet a reasonable measure in strength  .
i have no gift for the one and no strength for the other  , though i have the gift of strength  .
if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back  , under the correction of bragging be it spoken  , i should quickly leap into a wife  .
if i could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back though you may accuse me of boasting i could easily get myself a wife  .
or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors  , i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes  , never off  .
i can fight with my fists and rear my horse up without falling off him  , if either of those things could win me love  .
but  , before god  , kate  , i can not look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence  , nor i have no cunning in protestation  , only
but  ,
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france  ?
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france  ?
no  , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france  , kate  .
no  , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france  , kate  .
but  , in loving me  , you should love the friend of france  , for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it  .
but in loving me  , you would love the friend of france  , for i love france so much that i will not part with a single village of it  .
i will have it all mine  .
i will have it all mine  .
and  , kate  , when france is mine and i am yours  , then yours is france and you are mine  .
and  , kate  , when france is mine and i am yours  , then france is yours and you are mine  .

i will tell you in french  , which i am sure will hang as heavily on my tongue as a newly married wife around her husband 's neck  , impossible to shake off  .

(  ) i  , when  , on the possession of france  , and when you have the possession of me  (  ) let me see  , what then  ?
saint denis be my speed  !
help me  , saint denis  !

(  ) then yours is france and you are mine  .
it is as easy for me  , kate  , to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french  .
(  ) it would be as easy for me to reconquer the kingdom  , kate  , as it would be for me to speak that much french again  .
i shall never move thee in french  , unless it be to laugh at me  .
i 'll never move you in french  , except to laugh at me  .
i can not tell  .
i can not tell  .
and saint george  , compound a boy  , half french  , half english  , that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard  ?

i do not know dat  .

it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married  , would she say  ?
it is not the custom for the maids in france to kiss before they are married  , is that what she says  ?
god save your majesty  .
god save your majesty  .
my royal cousin  , teach you our princess english  ?
my royal kinsman  , are you teaching our princess english  ?
i would have her learn  , my fair cousin  , how perfectly i love her  , and that is good english  .
i wanted to teach her how perfectly i love her  , kinsman  , and that 's good english  .
is she not apt  ?
she picks it up quick  , does n't she  ?
pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that  .
forgive my boldness if i take you up on your words about making magic  .
if you would conjure in her  , you must make a circle  ; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness  , he must appear naked and blind  .
for love to appear in his true likeness  , he would have to be as cupid is  : naked and blind  .
can you blame her then  , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty  , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self  ?
how can you blame her  , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes  , for objecting to having a blind  , naked boy appear before her  ?
it were  , my lord  , a hard condition for a maid to consign to  .
it 's a lot to ask of a maiden  .
yet they do wink and yield  , as love is blind and enforces  .
but virgins close their eyes and submit all the time  , and blind love has his way  .
they are then excused  , my lord  , when they see not what they do  .
they 're forgiven  , then  , if they do n't see what they 're doing  .
then  , good my lord  , teach your cousin to consent winking  .
then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes  , my lord  .
this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer  .
so you 're telling me to give it time and wait for summer  .
and so i shall catch the fly  , your cousin  , in the latter end and she must be blind too  .
and even then  , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin  , she must be blind  ?
as love is  , my lord  , before it loves  .
like love  , my lord  , before it learns to love  .
shall kate be my wife  ?
shall kate be my wife  ?
so please you  .
if you wish  .
i am content  , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her  .
i am satisfied  , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her  .
so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will  .
that way  , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire  .
we have consented to all terms of reason  .
we have consented to all reasonable terms  .
is 't so  , my lords of england  ?
is that true  , my lords of england  ?
the king hath granted every article  , his daughter first  , and  , in sequel  , all  , according to their firm proposed natures  .
the king has agreed to every point  : first his daughter  , then everything else  , as you strictly proposed  .
only he hath not yet subscribd this  : where your majesty demands that the king of france  , having any occasion to write for matter of grant  , shall name your highness in this form and with this addition  , in french  :  ; and thus in latin  :
except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title in french  ,  ; and in latin  ,  ,
nor this i have not  , brother  , so denied but your request shall make me let it pass  .
and even this i 'm willing to grant if you request it  .
i pray you  , then  , in love and dear alliance  , let that one article rank with the rest  , and thereupon give me your daughter  .
in that case  , i ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest  , and bestow your daughter on me  .
may cease their hatred  , and this dear conjunction plant neighborhood and christian - like accord in their sweet bosoms  , that never war advance his bleeding sword 'twixt england and fair france  .
precious marriage cause friendship and alliance between them and war never again threaten england or fair france with his bloody sword  .
amen  .
amen  .
amen  .
amen  !
why  , sir  , a carpenter  .
i 'm a carpenter  , sir  .
where is thy leather apron and thy rule  ?
where are your leather apron and your ruler  ?
what dost thou with thy best apparel on  ?
what are you doing  , wearing your best clothes  ?
you  , sir  , what trade are you  ?
and you  , sir  , what 's trade  ?
truly  , sir  , in respect of a fine workman  , i am but  , as you would say  , a cobbler  .
well  , compared to a fine workman  , you might call me a mere cobbler  .
but what trade art thou  ?
but what 's your trade  ?
answer me directly  .
answer me straightforwardly  .
what trade  , thou knave  ?
what trade  , boy  ?
thou naughty knave  , what trade  ?
you insolent rascal  , what trade  ?
nay  , i beseech you  , sir  , be not out with me  .
sir  , please  , do n't be angry  .
yet  , if you be out  , sir  , i can mend you  .
but if your soles are worn out  , i can mend you  .
why  , sir  , cobble you  .
cobble you  , sir  .
thou art a cobbler  , art thou  ?
you 're a cobbler  , are you  ?
but wherefore art not in thy shop today  ?
but why are n't you in your shop today  ?
why dost thou lead these men about the streets  ?
why are you leading these men through the streets  ?
truly  , sir  , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work  .
well  , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work  .
but indeed  , sir  , we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph  .
seriously  , though  , we took the day off to see caesar  , sir  , and celebrate his triumph  .
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey 's blood  ?
and now you toss flowers in the path of caesar  , who comes in triumph over pompey 's defeated sons  ?
be gone  !
go home  !
run to your houses  , fall upon your knees  , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude  .
run to your houses  , fall on your knees  , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude  .
go  , go  , good countrymen  , and for this fault  , assemble all the poor men of your sort  , draw them to tiber banks  , and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all  .
go  , go  , good countrymen  , and to make up for having done wrong  , gather up all the poor men like yourselves  , lead them to the tiber  , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks  .
may we do so  ?
can we do that  ?
you know it is the feast of lupercal  .
you know it 's the feast of  .
it is no matter  .
it does n't matter  .
let no images be hung with caesar 's trophies  .
make sure that none of the statues are decorated in tribute to caesar  .
i 'll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets  .
i 'll walk around and force the commoners off the streets  .
so do you too  , where you perceive them thick  .
you do the same  , wherever the crowds are thick  .
these growing feathers plucked from caesar 's wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch  , who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness  .
if we take away caesar 's support  , he 'll have to come back down to earth  ; otherwise  , he 'll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience  .
calphurnia  !
calphurnia  !
peace  , ho  !
quiet  !
caesar speaks  .
caesar 's talking  .
calphurnia  !
calphurnia  !
here  , my lord  .
i 'm here  , my lord  .
stand you directly in antonius ' way when he doth run his course  .
stand right in antonius 's path when he runs the race  .
antonius  !
antonius  !
caesar  , my lord  .
yes  , caesar  ?
forget not in your speed  , antonius  , to touch calphurnia  , for our elders say the barren  , touchd in this holy chase  , shake off their sterile curse  .
antonius  , after you take off  , do n't forget to touch calphurnia  , because our wise elders say that if you touch an infertile woman during this holy race  , she 'll be freed from the curse of sterility  .
i shall remember  .
i 'll remember  .
when caesar says  , do this  , it is performed  .
when caesar says do this  , it is done  .
set on  , and leave no ceremony out  .
continue  , then  , and do n't forget to perform all of the rituals  .
caesar  !
caesar  !
bid every noise be still  .
quiet  , everyone  !
peace yet again  .
quiet  !
who is it in the press that calls on me  ?
who in the crowd is calling me  ?
i hear a tongue  , shriller than all the music  , cry caesar  !
i hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling caesar  !
speak  .
speak  .
caesar is turned to hear  .
caesar is listening  .
beware the ides of march  .
beware of march 15th  .
what man is that  ?
who 's that  ?
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march  .
a soothsayer tells you to beware of march 15th  .
set him before me  .
bring him in front of me  .
let me see his face  .
let me see his face  .
fellow  , come from the throng  .
you  , fellow  , step out of the crowd  .
look upon caesar  .
this is caesar you 're looking at  .
what sayst thou to me now  ?
what do you have to say to me now  ?
speak once again  .
speak once again  .
beware the ides of march  .
beware of march 15th  .
he is a dreamer  .
he 's insane  .
let us leave him  .
let 's leave him  .
pass  !
let 's move  .
will you go see the order of the course  ?
are you going to watch the race  ?
not i  .
not me  .
i pray you  , do  .
please  , come  .
i am not gamesome  .
i do n't like sports  .
i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony  .
i 'm not competitive like antony  .
let me not hinder  , cassius  , your desires  .
but do n't let me keep you from going  , cassius  .
i 'll leave you  .
i 'll go my own way  .
then  , brutus  , i have much mistook your passion  , by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value  , worthy cogitations  .
brutus  , i misunderstood your feelings  , and therefore kept to myself certain thoughts i might have shared  .
tell me  , good brutus  , can you see your face  ?
tell me  , good brutus  , can you see your face  ?
't is just  .
that 's true  .
and it is very much lamented  , brutus  , that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow  .
and it 's too bad  , brutus  , that you do n't have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself  .
i have heard where many of the best respect in rome  , except immortal caesar  , speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age 's yoke  , have wished that noble brutus had his eyes  .
i 've heard many of the noblest romans next to immortal caesar speaking of you  , complaining of the tyranny of today 's government  , and wishing that your eyes were working better  .
into what dangers would you lead me  , cassius  , that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me  ?
what dangers are you trying to lead me into  , cassius  , that you want me to look inside myself for something that 's not there  ?
therefore  , good brutus  , be prepared to hear  .
i 'll tell you  , good brutus  .
and since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection  , i  , your glass  , will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of  .
and since you know you can see yourself best by reflection  , i 'll be your mirror and show you  , without exaggeration  , things inside you that you ca n't see  .
and be not jealous on me  , gentle brutus  .
and do n't be suspicious of me  , noble brutus  .
were i a common laugher  , or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester  , if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and  , after  , scandal them  , or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout  , then hold me dangerous  .
if i were your average fool  , or if i made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody  , or if you 'd seen me first flattering men  , hugging them tightly  , and later slandering them behind their backs  , or if you hear that i drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble  , only then  , of course  , go ahead and assume i 'm dangerous  .
what means this shouting  ?
why are they shouting  ?
i do fear  , the people choose caesar for their king  .
i 'm afraid the people have made caesar their king  .
ay  , do you fear it  ?
really  , are you afraid of that  ?
then must i think you would not have it so  .
then i have to assume you do n't want him to be king  .
i would not  , cassius  .
i do n't  , cassius  , though i love caesar very much  .
yet i love him well  .
but why do you keep me here so long  ?
but wherefore do you hold me here so long  ?
what do you want to tell me  ?
what is it that you would impart to me  ?
if it 's for the good of all romans  , i 'd do it even if it meant my death  .
if it be aught toward the general good  , set honor in one eye and death i ' th ' other  , and i will look on both indifferently  , for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death  .
let the gods give me good luck only as long as i love honor more than i fear death  .
i know that virtue to be in you  , brutus  , as well as i do know your outward favor  .
i know this quality in you  , brutus it 's as familiar to me as your face  .
well  , honor is the subject of my story  .
indeed  , honor is what i want to talk to you about  .
i can not tell what you and other men think of this life  , but  , for my single self  , i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself  .
i do n't know what you and other men think of this life  , but as for me  , i 'd rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself  .
i was born free as caesar  .
i was born as free as caesar  .
so were you  .
so were you  .
we both have fed as well  , and we can both endure the winter 's cold as well as he  .
we both have eaten as well  , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he  .
for once upon a raw and gusty day  , the troubled tiber chafing with her shores  , caesar said to me  , darest thou  , cassius  , now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point  ?
once  , on a cold and windy day  , when the river tiber was crashing against its banks  , caesar said to me  , cassius  , i dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there  .
upon the word  , accoutred as i was  , i plungd in and bade him follow  .
as soon as he spoke  , though i was fully dressed  , i plunged in and called for him to follow  .
so indeed he did  .
and he did  .
the torrent roared  , and we did buffet it with lusty sinews  , throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy  .
the water roared  , and we fought against it with vigorous arms  .
but ere we could arrive the point proposed  , caesar cried  , help me  , cassius  , or i sink  !
and  , thanks to our fierce competitiveness  , we made progress  .
i  , as aeneas  , our great ancestor  , did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear  , so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar  .
but before we reached the end point  , caesar cried  , help me  , cassius  , or i will sink  !
and this man
and just as aeneas  , the hero who founded rome  , emerged from the fires of troy with his elderly father anchises on his shoulder  , so i emerged from the tiber carrying the tired caesar  .
is now become a god  , and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him  .
and this is the man who has now become a god  , and i 'm a wretched creature who must bow down if caesar so much as carelessly nods my way  .
he had a fever when he was in spain  , and when the fit was on him  , i did mark how he did shake  .
in spain  , caesar had a fever  , and it made him shake  .
't is true  , this god did shake  !
it 's true  , this so - called god he shook  .
his coward lips did from their color fly  , and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster  .
his cowardly lips turned white  , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam  .
i did hear him groan  , ay  , and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas  , it cried  , give me some drink  , titinius  , as a sick girl  .
i heard him groan yes  , i did and the same tongue that ordered the romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried  , give me some water  , titinius  , like a sick girl  .
ye gods  , it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone  .
it astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone  .
another general shout  !
more shouting  !
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar  .
i think this applause is for some new honors awarded to caesar  .
why  , man  , he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus  , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves  .
why  , caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant  , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably  , as slaves  .
men at some time are masters of their fates  .
men can be masters of their fate  .
the fault  , dear brutus  , is not in our stars but in ourselves  , that we are underlings  .
it is not destiny 's fault  , but our own faults  , that we 're slaves  .
brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar  ?
brutus and caesar  .
why should that name be sounded more than yours  ?
what 's so special about caesar  ?
write them together  , yours is as fair a name  .
why should that name be proclaimed more than yours  ?
sound them  , it doth become the mouth as well  .
write them together yours is just as good a name  .
weigh them  , it is as heavy  .
pronounce them it is just as nice to say  .
conjure with 'em  ,
weigh them it 's just as heavy  .
brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar  .
cast spells with them  , and brutus will call up a ghost as well as caesar  .
now in the names of all the gods at once  , upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great  ?
now  , in the name of all the gods  , i ask you what food does caesar eat that has made him grow so great  ?
age  , thou art shamed  !
our era should be ashamed  !
rome  , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods  !
rome has lost the ability to raise noble men  !
when went there by an age  , since the great flood  , but it was famed with more than with one man  ?
when was there ever an age  , since the beginning of time  , that did n't feature more than one famous man  ?
when could they say till now  , that talked of rome  , that her wide walks encompassed but one man  ?
until now  , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast rome  .
now is it rome indeed  , and room enough  , when there is in it but one only man  .
now  , though  , in all of rome  , there 's room for only one man  .
oh  , you and i have heard our fathers say  , there was a brutus once that would have brooked th ' eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king  .
you and i have heard our fathers talk of another brutus your ancestor who would 've let the devil himself reign in his roman republic before he let a king rule  .
that you do love me  , i am nothing jealous  .
i have no doubt that you love me  .
what you would work me to  , i have some aim  .
i 'm beginning to understand what you want me to do  .
how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter  .
what i think about this  , and about what 's happening here in rome  , i 'll tell you later  .
for this present  , i would not  , so with love i might entreat you  , be any further moved  .
for now  , do n't try to persuade me anymore i ask you as a friend  .
what you have said i will consider  , what you have to say i will with patience hear  , and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things  .
i 'll think over what you 've said  , i 'll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say  , and i 'll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters  .
till then  , my noble friend  , chew upon this  : brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us  .
until then  , my noble friend  , think about this  : i 'd rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through  .
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus  .
i 'm glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you  .
the games are done and caesar is returning  .
the games are done and caesar is returning  .
as they pass by  , pluck casca by the sleeve  , and he will  , after his sour fashion  , tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today  .
as they pass by  , grab casca by the sleeve  , and he 'll tell you if anything important happened today in his usual sour way  .
i will do so  .
i 'll do so  .
but  , look you  , cassius  , the angry spot doth glow on caesar 's brow  , and all the rest look like a chidden train  .
but look  , cassius  , caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they 've been scolded  .
calphurnia 's cheek is pale  , and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators  .
calphurnia 's face is pale  , and cicero 's eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the capitol  .
casca will tell us what the matter is  .
casca will tell us what 's the matter  .

yond cassius has a lean and hungry look  .

he thinks too much  .

such men are dangerous  .
men like him are dangerous  .
caesar fear him not  , caesar  .

brutus you pulled me by the cloak  .
brutus you tugged on my cloak  .
would you speak with me  ?
do you want to speak with me  ?

yes  , casca  .
tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad  .
tell us what happened today that put caesar in such a serious mood  .
why  , you were with him  , were you not  ?
but you were with him  , were n't you  ?
i should not then ask casca what had chanced  .
if i were  , i would n't need to ask you what happened  .
why  , there was a crown offered him  ; and  , being offered him  , he put it by with the back of his hand  , thus  ; and then the people fell a - shouting  .
a crown was offered to him  , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand  , like this and then the people started shouting  .

was the crown offered him thrice  ?
the crown was offered to him three times  ?
ay  , marry  , was 't  , and he put it by thrice  , every time gentler than other  , and at every putting - by mine honest neighbors shouted  .
yes  , indeed  , it was  , and he pushed it away three times  , each time more gently than the last  ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted  .
who offered him the crown  ?

why  , antony  .
antony  .

but soft  , i pray you  .
but wait a minute  , please  .
what  , did caesar swoon  ?
did you say caesar fainted  ?
he fell down in the marketplace  , and foamed at mouth  , and was speechless  .
he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless  .
't is very like  .
that 's very likely  .
he hath the falling sickness  .
he has epilepsy  , a disease where you fall down  .
no  , caesar hath it not  .
no  , caesar does n't have epilepsy  .
but you and i and honest casca  , we have the falling sickness  .
you and i  , and honest casca  , we have epilepsy we 've fallen  .
what said he when he came unto himself  ?
what did he say when he regained consciousness  ?
and after that he came thus sad away  ?
and after that he came back here looking so serious  ?
ay  .
yes  .
did cicero say anything  ?
did cicero say anything  ?
ay  , he spoke greek  .
yes  , he said something in greek  .
to what effect  ?
what did he say  ?
nay  , an i tell you that  , i 'll ne'er look you i ' th ' face again  .
if i told you i understood greek  , i 'd be lying  .
but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads  .
but those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads  .
but  , for mine own part  , it was greek to me  .
as for myself  , it was greek to me  .
i could tell you more news too  .
i have more news too  .
murellus and flavius  , for pulling scarfs off caesar 's images  , are put to silence  .
murellus and flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of caesar  .
fare you well  .
there you go  .
there was more foolery yet  , if i could remember it  .
there was even more foolishness  , if i could only remember it  .
will you sup with me tonight  , casca  ?
will you have dinner with me tonight  , casca  ?
no  , i am promised forth  .
no  , i have a commitment  .
will you dine with me tomorrow  ?
will you dine with me tomorrow  ?
ay  , if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating  .
yes  , if i 'm still alive  , and you 're still sane  , and your dinner is worth eating  .
good  .
good  .
i will expect you  .
i 'll expect you  .
do so  .
do so  .
farewell both  .
farewell to you both  .
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be  !
what a stupid man he 's become  !
he was quick mettle when he went to school  .
he was so sharp when he was in school  .
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise  , however he puts on this tardy form  .
he 's still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise  , though he puts on this show of stupidity  .
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit  , which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite  .
he speaks roughly  , but what he says is smart  , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him  .
and so it is  .
you 're right  , that 's how it is  .
for this time i will leave you  .
i 'll leave you for now  .
tomorrow  , if you please to speak with me  , i will come home to you  .
if you 'd like to talk tomorrow  , i 'll come to your home  .
or  , if you will  , come home to me  , and i will wait for you  .
or  , if you do n't mind  , come to my home  , and i 'll wait for you  .
i will do so  .
i 'll do so  .
till then  , think of the world  .
until then  , think about the well - being of rome  .
are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm  ?
are n't you disturbed when the earth itself is shaking and swaying as if it were a flimsy thing  ?
o cicero  , i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks  , and i have seen th ' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds  , but never till tonight  , never till now  , did i go through a tempest dropping fire  .
cicero  , i 've seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees  , and i 've seen the ocean swell  , rage  , and foam  , as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds  , but never before tonight  , never until now  , have i experienced a storm that drops fire  .
either there is a civil strife in heaven  , or else the world  , too saucy with the gods  , incenses them to send destruction  .
either there are wars in heaven  , or else the world  , too insolent toward the gods  , provokes them to send destruction  .
why  , saw you anything more wonderful  ?
what have you seen something so strange that it is clearly an omen from the gods  ?
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon - day upon the marketplace  , hooting and shrieking  .
and yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon  .
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet  , let not men say  , these are their reasons  .
when all these extraordinary things happen at once  , we should n't say  , these happenings can be explained rationally  .
they are natural  .
they 're natural enough  .
for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon  .
i think these things are omens of things to come in our country  .
indeed  , it is a strange - disposd time  .
indeed  , it 's a strange time  .
but men may construe things after their fashion  , clean from the purpose of the things themselves  .
but men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves  .
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow  ?
is caesar visiting the capitol tomorrow  ?
he doth  , for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow  .
he is  , because he told antonius to tell you he 'd be there tomorrow  .
good night then  , casca  .
good night then  , casca  .
this disturbd sky is not to walk in  .
this bad weather is n't good to walk around in  .
farewell  , cicero  .
farewell  , cicero
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?
a roman  .
a roman  .
casca  , by your voice  .
it 's casca i know your voice  .
your ear is good  .
your ear is good  .
cassius  , what night is this  !
cassius  , what a night this is  !
a very pleasing night to honest men  .
it 's a very pleasing night to honest men  .
who ever knew the heavens menace so  ?
who ever saw the heavens threaten like this  ?
those that have known the earth so full of faults  .
those who have known how bad things are here on earth  .
for my part  , i have walked about the streets  , submitting me unto the perilous night  , and  , thus unbracd  , casca  , as you see  , have bared my bosom to the thunder - stone  .
i have walked around the streets  , exposing myself to the perilous night  , unbuttoned like this  , as you see  , casca  , baring my chest to the thunderbolt  .
and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven  , i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it  .
when the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky  , i put myself right where i thought it would hit  .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens  ?
but why did you tempt the heavens like that  ?
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us  .
mankind 's role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals  .
a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action  , yet prodigious grown  , and fearful as these strange eruptions are  .
a man no mightier than you or i in ability  , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight 's strange happenings  .
indeed  , they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king  , and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy  .
indeed  , they say that the senators plan to establish caesar as a king tomorrow  , and he 'll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in italy  .
i know where i will wear this dagger then  .
i know where i 'll wear this dagger  , then  .
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius  .
i 'll kill myself to save myself from slavery  .
therein  , ye gods  , you make the weak most strong  .
in suicide  , gods make the weak strong  .
therein  , ye gods  , you tyrants do defeat  .
in suicide  , gods allow tyrants to be defeated  .
nor stony tower  , nor walls of beaten brass  , nor airless dungeon  , nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit  .
no stony tower  , no brass walls  , no airless dungeon  , no iron chains can contain a strong mind  .
but life  , being weary of these worldly bars  , never lacks power to dismiss itself  .
but if a man becomes weary of these obstacles  , he can always kill himself  .
if i know this  , know all the world besides  , that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure  .
let everyone beware  : i can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever i choose  .
so can i .
so can i .
so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity  .
in fact  , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself  .
and why should caesar be a tyrant then  ?
how can caesar be a tyrant then  ?
poor man  !
poor man  !
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep  .
i know he would n't be a wolf if the romans did n't act like sheep  .
he were no lion were not romans hinds  .
he could n't be a lion if the romans were n't such easy prey  .
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws  .
people who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs  .
what trash is rome  , what rubbish and what offal  , when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar  !
rome becomes complete trash  , nothing but rubbish and garbage  , when it works to light up the ambitions of someone as worthless as caesar  .
but  , o grief  , where hast thou led me  ?
but  , oh no  !
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman  .
what have i said in my grief  ?
then i know my answer must be made  .
i might be speaking to someone who to be a slave  , in which case i 'll be held accountable for my words  .
but i am armed  , and dangers are to me indifferent  .
but i 'm armed and i do n't care about danger  .
stand close awhile  , for here comes one in haste  .
hide for a minute someone 's approaching fast  .
't is cinna  .
it 's cinna  .
i do know him by his gait  .
i recognize his walk  .
he is a friend  .
he 's a friend  .
cinna  , where haste you so  ?
cinna  , where are you going in such a hurry  ?
to find out you  .
to find you  .
who 's that  ?
who 's that  ?
metellus cimber  ?
metellus cimber  ?
no  , it is casca  , one incorporate to our attempts  .
no  , it 's casca  , someone who 's going to work with us  .
am i not stayed for  , cinna  ?
are n't the others waiting for me  , cinna  ?
i am glad on 't  .
i 'm glad casca is with us  .
what a fearful night is this  !
what a fearful night this is  !
there 's two or three of us have seen strange sights  .
two or three of us have seen strange things  .
am i not stayed for  ?
are the others waiting  ?
tell me  .
tell me  .
yes  , you are  .
yes  , they are  .
o cassius  , if you could but win the noble brutus to our party
oh  , cassius  , if you could only convince brutus to join us
all but metellus cimber  , and he 's gone to seek you at your house  .
everyone 's there except metellus cimber  , and he 's gone to look for you at your house  .
well  , i will hie  , and so bestow these papers as you bade me  .
well  , i 'll hurry and put these papers where you told me  .
that done  , repair to pompey 's theatre  .
when you 've finished  , go back to pompey 's theater  .
come  , casca  , you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house  .
come on  , casca  , you and i will go see brutus at his house before sunrise  .
three parts of him is ours already  , and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours  .
he 's three - quarters on our side already  , and we 'll win him over entirely at this meeting  .
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited  .
yes  , you 're absolutely right about how worthy brutus is and how much we need him  .
let us go  , for it is after midnight  , and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him  .
let 's go  , because it 's already after midnight  , and we want him on our side before daylight  .
called you  , my lord  ?
did you call me  , my lord  ?
get me a taper in my study  , lucius  .
put a candle in my study  , lucius  .
when it is lighted  , come and call me here  .
call me when it 's lit  .
i will  , my lord  .
i will  , my lord  .
th ' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power  .
rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion  .
and  , to speak truth of caesar  , i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason  .
to be honest  , i 've never known caesar to let his emotions get the better of his reason  .
but 't is a common proof that lowliness is young ambition 's ladder  , whereto the climber upward turns his face  .
but everyone knows that an ambitious young man uses humility to advance himself  , but when he reaches the top  , he turns his back on his supporters and reaches for the skies while scorning those who helped him get where he is  .
but when he once attains the upmost round  , he then unto the ladder turns his back  , looks in the clouds  , scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend  .
caesar might act like that  .
so caesar may  .
therefore  , in case he does  , we must hold him back  .
then  , lest he may  , prevent  .
and since our quarrel is with his future behavior  , not what he does now  , i must frame the argument like this  : if his position is furthered  , his character will fulfill these predictions  .
and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is  , fashion it thus  : that what he is  , augmented  , would run to these and these extremities  .
and therefore we should liken him to a serpent 's egg once it has hatched  , it becomes dangerous  , like all serpents  .
and therefore think him as a serpent 's egg which  , hatched  , would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell  .
thus we must kill him while he 's still in the shell  .
get you to bed again  .
go back to bed  .
it is not day  .
it is n't daybreak yet  .
is not tomorrow  , boy  , the ides of march  ?
is tomorrow the 15th of march  , boy  ?
i know not  , sir  .
i do n't know  , sir  .
look in the calendar and bring me word  .
check the calendar and come tell me  .
i will  , sir  .
i will  , sir  .
the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them  .
the meteors whizzing in the sky are so bright that i can read by them  .
brutus  , thou sleep'st  .
brutus  , you 're sleeping  .
awake  , and see thyself  .
wake up and look at yourself  .
shall rome  , etc  .
is rome going to etc  .
speak  , strike  , redress  !
speak  , strike  , fix the wrongs  !
brutus  , thou sleep'st  .
brutus  , you 're sleeping  .
awake  .
wake up  .
such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up  .
i 've noticed many such calls to action left where i would find them  .
shall rome  , etc  .
is rome going to etc  .
thus must i piece it out  : shall rome stand under one man 's awe  ?
what does this mean  ?
what  , rome  ?
will rome submit to one man 's power  ?
my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was called a king  .
my ancestors drove tarquin from the streets of rome when he was pronounced a king  .
speak  , strike  , redress  !
speak  , strike  , fix it  !
am i entreated to speak and strike  ?
is this asking me to speak and strike  ?
o rome  , i make thee promise  , if the redress will follow  , thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus  !
oh  , rome  , i promise you  , if you 're meant to receive justice  , you 'll receive it by my hand  !
sir  , march is wasted fifteen days  .
sir  , fifteen days of march have gone by  .
't is good  .

go to the gate  .

somebody knocks  .
somebody 's knocking  .
since cassius first did whet me against caesar  , i have not slept  .
i have n't slept since cassius first began to turn me against caesar  .
between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion  , all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream  .
from the time when you decide to do something terrible to the moment you do it  , everything feels unreal  , like a horrible dream  .
the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council  , and the state of man  , like to a little kingdom  , suffers then the nature of an insurrection  .
the unconscious and the body work together and rebel against the conscious mind  .
is he alone  ?
is he alone  ?
do you know them  ?
do you know them  ?
let 'em enter  .
let them in  .
they are the faction  .
it 's the faction that wants to kill caesar  .
o conspiracy  , shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free  ?
oh  , conspiracy  , are you ashamed to show your face even at night  , when evil things are most free  ?
o  , then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage  ?
if so  , when it 's day  , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face  ?
seek none  , conspiracy  .
no  , do n't bother to find a cave  , conspiracy  .
hide it in smiles and affability  .
instead  , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness  .
for if thou path  , thy native semblance on  , not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention  .
if you went ahead and exposed your true face  , hell itself would n't be dark enough to keep you from being found and stopped  .
i think we are too bold upon your rest  .
i 'm afraid we 're intruding too boldly on your sleep time  .
good morrow  , brutus  .
good morning  , brutus  .
do we trouble you  ?
are we bothering you  ?
he is welcome hither  .
he 's welcome here  .
this  , decius brutus  .
this is decius brutus  .
he is welcome too  .

this is casca  .

they are all welcome  .

what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night  ?
what worries have kept you awake tonight  ?
shall i entreat a word  ?
can i have a word with you  ?
here lies the east  .
here 's the east  .
doth not the day break here  ?
wo n't the dawn come from here  ?
no  .
no  .
cassius give me your hands all over  , one by one  .
cassius give me your hands  , all of you  , one by one  .
and let us swear our resolution  .
and let us swear to our resolution  .
no  , not an oath  .
no  , let 's not swear an oath  .
if not the face of men  , the sufferance of our souls  , the time 's abuse if these be motives weak  , break off betimes  , and every man hence to his idle bed  .
if the sad faces of our fellow men  , the suffering of our own souls  , and the corruption of the present time are n't enough to motivate us  , let 's break it off now and each of us go back to bed  .
so let high - sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery  .
then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim  .
but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women  , then  , countrymen  , what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress  ?
but if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave and i think we do then  , countrymen  , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action  ?
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter  ?
what bond do we need other than that of discreet romans who have said what they 're going to do and wo n't back down  ?
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged  , that this shall be  , or we will fall for it  ?
and what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying  ?
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous  , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs  .
swearing is for priests  , cowards  , overly cautious men  , feeble old people  , and those long - suffering weaklings who welcome abuse  .
unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt  .
only men whom you would n't trust anyway would swear oaths  , and for the worst reasons  .
but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise  , nor th ' insuppressive mettle of our spirits  , to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath  , when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him  .
do n't spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath  , when the blood that every noble roman contains within him would be proven bastard 's blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made  .
but what of cicero  ?
but what about cicero  ?
shall we sound him  ?
should we see what he thinks  ?
i think he will stand very strong with us  .
i think he will stand strong with us  .
let us not leave him out  .
let 's not leave him out  .
no  , by no means  .
no  , by no means  .
o  , let us have him  , for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men 's voices to commend our deeds  .
yes  , we should get his support  , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions  .
it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands  .
they 'll assume that cicero  , with his sound judgment  , ordered the actions  .
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear  , but all be buried in his gravity  .
his dignified maturity will distract attention from our youth and wildness  .
then leave him out  .
then leave him out  .
indeed he is not fit  .
indeed  , he 's not right for this  .
alas  , good cassius  , do not think of him  .
alas  , good cassius  , do n't think about him  .
if he love caesar  , all that he can do is to himself  : take thought and die for caesar  .
if he loves caesar  , then he can only hurt himself by grieving and dying for caesar  .
and that were much he should  , for he is given to sports  , to wildness and much company  .

gentlemen  , i do n't know what you intend to do  , who else you intend to kill  , who else you consider corrupt  .
if i myself  , there is no hour so fit as caesar 's death 's hour  , nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords  , made rich with the most noble blood of all this world  .
if it 's me  , there 's no time as good as this hour of caesar 's death  , and no weapon better than your swords  , covered with the noblest blood in the world  .
i do beseech ye  , if you bear me hard  , now  , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke  , fulfill your pleasure  .
i ask you  , if you have a grudge against me  , to kill me now  , while your stained hands still reek of blood  .
live a thousand years  , i shall not find myself so apt to die  .
i could live a thousand years and i would n't be as ready to die as i am now  .
no place will please me so  , no mean of death  , as here by caesar  , and by you cut off  , the choice and master spirits of this age  .
there 's no place i 'd rather die than here by caesar  , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you  , the masters of this new era  .
your voice shall be as strong as any man 's in the disposing of new dignities  .
your vote will be as strong as anyone 's in the reordering of the government  .

does it really make sense  , once we divide the world into three parts  , that he should be one of the three rulers  ?
octavius  , i have seen more days than you  .
octavius  , i 'm older than you are  .
and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads  , he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold  , to groan and sweat under the business  , either led or driven  , as we point the way  .
and although we 're giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we 're doing  , he 'll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold groaning and sweating under the load  , either led or pushed  , as we direct him  .
and having brought our treasure where we will  , then take we down his load and turn him off  , like to the empty ass  , to shake his ears and graze in commons  .
once he 's carried our treasure where we want it  , we 'll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass  , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures  .
you may do your will  , but he 's a tried and valiant soldier  .
you can do what you want  , but he 's an experienced and honorable soldier  .
and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed  , and open perils surest answered  .
let 's immediately organize a council to discuss the best way to find out their secrets and the safest way to confront the threats we 're already faced with  .
stand  , ho  !
stop  .
give the word  , ho  , and stand  .
pass on the command to halt  !
what now  , lucillius  ?
what 's happening now  , lucillius  ?
is cassius near  ?
is cassius nearby  ?
he is at hand  , and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master  .
he 's nearby  , and pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master  .
he greets me well  .
he sends his greetings through a good man  .
your master  , pindarus  , in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done  , undone  .
your master  , pindarus  , either because he 's changed his mind or been influenced by bad officers  , has made me wish we had n't done some of the things we did  .
but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied  .
if he 's nearby  , i want an explanation  .
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is  , full of regard and honor  .
i have no doubt that my noble master will prove himself to be what he is  : honorable and noble  .
but when they should endure the bloody spur  , they fall their crests and  , like deceitful jades  , sink in the trial  .
but when push comes to shove  , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl  .
comes his army on  ?
is his army approaching  ?
they mean this night in sardis to be quartered  .
they plan to spend the night in sardis  .
the greater part  , the horse in general  , are come with cassius  .
the larger part  , the main body of cavalry  , are coming with cassius  .
hark  !
look  !
he is arrived  .
he 's arrived  .
march gently on to meet him  .
march to meet him at a dignified pace  .
stand  , ho  !
halt  .
stand  , ho  !
halt  !
speak the word along  .
pass the order along  .
stand  !
halt  !
stand  !
halt  !
stand  !
halt  !
most noble brother  , you have done me wrong  .
most noble brother  , you have done me wrong  .
brutus  , this sober form of yours hides wrongs  .
brutus  , your sober expression is a mask to hide the fact that you 've wronged me  .
and when you do them
and when you do
pindarus  , bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground  .
pindarus  , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground  .
that you have wronged me doth appear in this  : you have condemned and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians  , wherein my letters  , praying on his side because i knew the man  , were slighted off  .
my evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced lucius pella for taking bribes here from the sardinians  , and you ignored my letters  , where i argued that he was innocent  ; i know the man  .
you wronged yourself to write in such a case  .
you wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man  .
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment  .
in a time like this  , it does n't make sense to criticize every offense  .
let me tell you  , cassius  , you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm  , to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers  .
i 'll tell you  , cassius  , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold  .
i an itching palm  !
me  , greedy  !
you know that you are brutus that speak this  , or  , by the gods  , this speech were else your last  .
you know  , if you were anyone other than brutus  , that speech would be your last  .
the name of cassius honors this corruption  , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head  .
the name of cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions  , and so they go unpunished  .
chastisement  !
unpunished  !
remember march  , the ides of march remember  .
remember march  , march 15th  .
did not great julius bleed for justice ' sake  ?
did n't great caesar bleed for the sake of justice  ?
brutus  , bait not me  .
brutus  , do not provoke me  .
i 'll not endure it  .
i will not take it  .
you forget yourself to hedge me in  .
you 're forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner  .
i am a soldier  , i  , older in practice  , abler than yourself to make conditions  .
i 'm a soldier  , more experienced than you  , and better able to give orders  .
go to  .
get lost  !
you are not  , cassius  .
you are not  , cassius  .
i am  .
i am  .
i say you are not  .
i say you 're not  .
urge me no more  , i shall forget myself  .
do n't provoke me any further or i 'll forget to restrain myself  .
have mind upon your health  , tempt me no further  .
if you care about your health  , you wo n't push me any further  .
away  , slight man  !
leave  , you little man  .
is 't possible  ?
is this possible  ?
hear me  , for i will speak  .
listen to me  , for i have something to tell you  .
must i give way and room to your rash choler  ?
am i required to indulge your rash anger  ?
shall i be frighted when a madman stares  ?
does a madman scare me when he stares at me  ?
is it come to this  ?
has it come to this  ?
you say you are a better soldier  .
you say you 're a better soldier  .
let it appear so  .
show it  !
make your vaunting true  , and it shall please me well  .
make your boasts come true  , and i 'll be thrilled  .
for mine own part  , i shall be glad to learn of noble men  .
i 'm always happy to hear about brave men  .
you wrong me every way  .
you wrong me in every way  .
you wrong me  , brutus  .
you wrong me  , brutus  .
i said an elder soldier  , not a better  .
i said an soldier  , not a better one  .
did i say better  ?
did i say better  ?
if you did  , i care not  .
if you did  , i do n't care  .
when caesar lived  , he durst not thus have moved me  .
when caesar was alive  , even he would n't dare anger me like this  .
peace  , peace  !
oh  , be quiet  .
you durst not so have tempted him  .
you would n't have dared to tempt him so  .
i durst not  !
i would n't have dared  !
no  .
no  .
for your life you durst not  .
you would n't have dared  , out of fear for your life  .
do not presume too much upon my love  .
do n't take my love for granted  .
i may do that i shall be sorry for  .
i might do something i 'll be sorry for  .
you have done that you should be sorry for  .
you 've already done something you should be sorry for  .
there is no terror  , cassius  , in your threats  , for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind  , which i respect not  .
your threats do n't scare me  , cassius  , because i 'm so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze  .
i did send to you for certain sums of gold  , which you denied me  , for i can raise no money by vile means  .
i asked you for a certain amount of gold  , which you would n't give me  .
by heaven  , i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection  .
i myself ca n't raise money by unethical means  .
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions  , which you denied me  .
i 'd rather turn my heart into money and my drops of blood into coins than use crooked tactics to wring petty cash from the hardworking hands of peasants  .
was that done like cassius  ?
i asked you for gold to pay my soldiers  , and you would n't give it to me  .
should i have answered caius cassius so  ?
was that the caius cassius that i knew  ?
when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends  , be ready  , gods  , with all your thunderbolts  .
and would i have ever done that to you  ?
dash him to pieces  !
if i ever get so greedy that i hoard such petty cash from my friends  , may the gods dash me to pieces with their thunderbolts  !
i denied you not  .
i did n't refuse you  .
you did  .
you did  .
i did not  .
i did n't  .
he was but a fool that brought my answer back  .
the man who brought my answer to you was a fool  .
brutus hath rived my heart  .
you have broken my heart  .
a friend should bear his friend 's infirmities  , but brutus makes mine greater than they are  .
a friend should put up with his friend 's weaknesses  , but you exaggerate mine  .
i do not  , till you practice them on me  .
i do n't until you practice them on me  .
you love me not  .
you do n't love me  .
i do not like your faults  .
i do n't like your faults  .
a friendly eye could never see such faults  .
a friend would never see those faults  .
a flatterer 's would not  , though they do appear as huge as high olympus  .
no  , a flatterer would n't  , even if the faults were as huge as mount olympus  .
come  , antony  , and young octavius  , come  , revenge yourselves alone on cassius  , for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves  ; braved by his brother  ; checked like a bondman  , all his faults observed  , set in a notebook  , learned  , and conned by rote to cast into my teeth  .
come  , antony and young octavius  !
oh  , i could weep my spirit from mine eyes  .
get your revenge on cassius  , because cassius has grown tired of the world  .
brutus there is my dagger  .
he 's hated by someone he loves  , defied by his brother  , rebuked like a servant  , all his faults observed  , catalogued in a notebook  , read  , and committed to memory so they can be thrown in his face  .
and here my naked breast  .
oh  , i could weep my soul right out of myself  !
within  , a heart dearer than plutus ' mine  , richer than gold  .
there 's my dagger brutus  , and here 's my bare chest  .
if that thou beest a roman  , take it forth  .
inside it is a heart more valuable than silver mine and richer than gold  .
i  , that denied thee gold  , will give my heart  .
if you 're a roman  , take my heart out  .
strike  , as thou didst at caesar  .
i  , who denied you gold  , will give you my heart  .
for i know when thou didst hate him worst  , thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius  .
strike as you did at caesar  , for i know even when you hated him the most  , you still loved him better than you ever loved me  .
hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus  , when grief and blood ill - tempered vexeth him  ?
have i lived this long only to be the butt of a joke whenever you 're angry or frustrated  ?
when i spoke that  , i was ill - tempered too  .
when i said that  , i was angry too  .
do you confess so much  ?
you admit it  , then  ?
give me your hand  .
give me your hand  .
and my heart too  .
and my heart too  .
o brutus  !
oh  , brutus  !
what 's the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
have not you love enough to bear with me  , when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful  ?
do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper  , which i inherited from my mother  , makes me forget how i should behave  ?
yes  , cassius  .
yes  , cassius  .
and from henceforth when you are over - earnest with your brutus  , he 'll think your mother chides and leave you so  .
and from now on  , when you get hot with me  , i 'll assume it 's your mother speaking and leave it at that  .
you shall not come to them  .
you ca n't see them  .
nothing but death shall stay me  .
you 'd have to kill me to stop me  .
how now  ?
what 's this  !
what 's the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
for shame  , you generals  !
you should be ashamed  , generals  !
what do you mean  ?
what do you think you 're doing  ?
love  , and be friends as two such men should be  .
love each other and be friends  , like two such men should be  .
for i have seen more years  , i 'm sure  , than ye  .
listen to me  , because i 'm older than you  , surely  .
poet get you hence  , sirrah  .
poet get out of here  , you  !
saucy fellow  , hence  !
get away  , you rude fellow  !
bear with him  , brutus  .
be patient with him  , brutus  .
't is his fashion  .
that 's just how he is  .
i 'll know his humor when he knows his time  .
i 'll humor him when he learns how to behave  .
what should the wars do with these jigging fools  ?
what should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post  ?
companion  , hence  !
get out of here  , my friend  .
away  , away  , be gone  .
away  , away  , be gone  .
lucillius and titinius  , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight  .
lucillius and titinius  , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night  .
and come yourselves  , and bring messala with you  , immediately to us  .
and return to us immediately  , bringing messala with you  .
lucius  , a bowl of wine  !
lucius  , bring a bowl of wine  .
i did not think you could have been so angry  .
i did n't think you could even be so angry  .
o cassius  , i am sick of many griefs  .
oh cassius  , i 'm tired out by many sorrows  .
of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils  .
you 're forgetting your philosophy if you allow chance misfortunes to upset you  .
no man bears sorrow better  .
no one bears sorrow better than me  .
portia is dead  .
portia is dead  .
ha  , portia  ?
portia  !
she is dead  .
she is dead  .
how 'scaped i killing when i crossed you so  ?
how did you manage not to kill me when we argued just now  ?
o insupportable and touching loss  !
what an irreplaceable and grievous loss  !
upon what sickness  ?
what sickness did she die of  ?
and died so  ?
and that 's how she died  ?
even so  .
yes  , like that  .
o ye immortal gods  !
oh  , immortal gods  !
speak no more of her  .
do n't talk about her anymore  .
give me a bowl of wine  .
give me a bowl of wine  .
in this i bury all unkindness  , cassius  .
with this toast i bury all bad feelings between us  , cassius  .
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge  .
my heart is thirsty for that noble promise  .
fill  , lucius  , till the wine o'erswell the cup  .

i can not drink too much of brutus ' love  .
i can not drink too much of brutus 's love  .
come in  , titinius  .
come in  , titinius  !
welcome  , good messala  !
welcome  , good messala  .
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities  .
now let 's sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs  .
portia  , art thou gone  ?
portia  , are you really gone  ?
no more  , i pray you  .
no more about that  , please  .
messala  , i have here receivd letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power  , bending their expedition toward philippi  .
messala  , i have received these letters explaining that young octavius and mark antony are rushing toward philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power  .
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor  .
i have received letters that say the same  .
with what addition  ?
and anything else  ?
that by proscription and bills of outlawry  , octavius  , antony  , and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators  .
that with a series of legal writs  , octavius  , antony  , and lepidus have put a hundred senators to death  .
therein our letters do not well agree  .
on that point  , our letters do n't agree  .
mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions  , cicero being one  .
my letters say only seventy senators were killed  , one being cicero  .
cicero one  ?
cicero too  ?
cicero is dead  , and by that order of proscription  .
cicero is dead  , by their decree  .
brutus had you your letters from your wife  , my lord  ?
brutus have you received letters from your wife  , my lord  ?
no  , messala  .
no  , messala  .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her  ?
and you have n't heard any news about her in your letters  ?
nothing  , messala  .
nothing  , messala  .
that methinks is strange  .
i think that 's strange  .
why ask you  ?
why do you ask  ?
hear you aught of her in yours  ?
have you heard something of her in your letters  ?
no  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  .
now  , as you are a roman  , tell me true  .
now  , as you 're a roman  , tell me the truth  .
then like a roman bear the truth i tell  .
then you must take the truth i have to tell like a roman  .
for certain she is dead  , and by strange manner  .
it 's certain that she is dead  , and she died in a strange way  .
why  , farewell  , portia  .
well  , good - bye  , portia  .
we must die  , messala  .
we all must die  , messala  .
with meditating that she must die once  , i have the patience to endure it now  .
having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime  , i can endure her death now  .
even so great men great losses should endure  .
that 's the way great men ought to endure great losses  .
i have as much of this in art as you  , but yet my nature could not bear it so  .
i 've practiced stoicism with as much devotion as you  , but i still could n't bear this news like you do  .
well  , to our work alive  .
well  , let 's move on to our work with the living  .
what do you think of marching to philippi presently  ?
what do you think of marching to philippi immediately  ?
i do not think it good  .
i do n't think it 's a good idea  .
your reason  ?
why not  ?
this it is  : 't is better that the enemy seek us  .
here 's why  : it 'd be better for the enemy to come after us  .
so shall he waste his means  , weary his soldiers  , doing himself offense  , whilst we  , lying still  , are full of rest  , defense  , and nimbleness  .
that way  , he 'll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers  , weakening his own capacities  , while we  , lying still  , are rested  , energetic  , and nimble  .
hear me  , good brother
listen to me  , good brother  .
then  , with your will  , go on  .
if that 's what you want  , all right  .
we 'll along ourselves  , and meet them at philippi  .
we 'll go forward with you and meet them at philippi  .
the deep of night is crept upon our talk  , and nature must obey necessity  , which we will niggard with a little rest  .
it 's now late at night  , and actions must accommodate bodily needs  , which we 'll satisfy with only a short rest  .
there is no more to say  ?
that 's all there is to say  .
no more  .
there 's nothing else  .
good night  .
good night  .

i have slept  , my lord  , already  .
i 've already slept  , my lord  .
it was well done  , and thou shalt sleep again  .

i will not hold thee long  .

this candle does n't give much light  .
how ill this taper burns  !

i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition  .
i think it 's my bad eyesight that 's making me see this horrible vision  .
it comes upon me  .
it 's coming toward me  .
art thou any thing  ?
are you real  ?

now  , antony  , our hopes are answerd  .
now  , antony  , our prayers have been answered  .
you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions  .
you said the enemy would n't come down but keep to the hills and upper regions  .
it proves not so  .
it seems not  .
their battles are at hand  .
their forces are nearby  .
they mean to warn us at philippi here  , answering before we do demand of them  .
they intend to challenge us here at philippi  , responding to our challenge before we 've even challenged him  .
tut  , i am in their bosoms  , and i know wherefore they do it  .

he 's been gone for nine years and he 's leaving again soon  .
the king is coming  .

to thine and albany 's issue be this perpetual  .
this land will belong to your and albany 's children forever  .
what says our second daughter  , our dearest regan  , wife of cornwall  ?
and now what does my second daughter regan  , the wife of cornwall  , have to say  ?
speak  .
tell me  .
then poor cordelia  !
poor me  , what am i going to say now  ?
and yet not so  , since i am sure my love 's more ponderous than my tongue  .
but i 'm not poor in love my love is bigger than my words are  .
nothing  , my lord  .
nothing  , my lord  .
nothing  ?
nothing  ?
nothing  .
nothing  .
how  , how  , cordelia  ?
what are you saying  , cordelia  ?
mend your speech a little  , lest you may mar your fortunes  .
revise your statement  , or you may damage your inheritance  .
but goes thy heart with this  ?
but do you mean what you 're saying  ?
ay  , good my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
so young and so untender  ?
so young and so cruel  ?
so young  , my lord  , and true  .
so young  , my lord  , and honest  .
good my liege
but sir
royal lear  , whom i have ever honored as my king  , loved as my father  , as my master followed  , as my great patron thought on in my prayers
king lear  , i 've always honored you as king  , loved you as my father  , obeyed you as my master  , and thanked you in my prayers
the bow is bent and drawn  .
i 'm furious and ready to snap  .
make from the shaft  .
stay away or else i 'll take my anger out on you  .
kent  , on thy life  , no more  .
kent  , if you want to stay alive  , stop talking  .
out of my sight  !
get out of my sight  !
see better  , lear  , and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye  .
learn to see better  , lear  , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice  .
now  , by apollo
now  , i swear by apollo
now  , by apollo  , king  , thou swear'st thy gods in vain  .
by apollo  , king  , you 're taking the names of the gods in vain  .
o vassal  !
oh  , you lowlife  !
miscreant  !
scum  !
dear sir  , forbear  !
please stop  , sir  .
our potency made good  , take thy reward  : five days we do allot thee for provision to shield thee from diseases of the world  .
king which i ca n't put up with either as a ruler or as a person  .
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom  .
this is your punishment  : i 'll give you five days to gather together what you need to survive  , then on the sixth day you 'll leave this kingdom that hates you  .
if on the next day following thy banished trunk be found in our dominions  , the moment is thy death  .
if the day after that you 're found in my kingdom  , you die  .
away  !
now get out of here  !
by jupiter  , this shall not be revoked  .
i swear by jupiter i 'll never revoke this punishment  .
why  , fare thee well  , king  .
farewell  , king  .
sith thus thou wilt appear  , freedom lives hence  , and banishment is here  .
if this is how you act  , it 's clear that freedom has been banished from this kingdom  .
cordelia the gods to their dear shelter take thee  , maid  , that justly think'st and hast most rightly said  !
cordelia i hope the gods will protect you  , my dear girl  , for thinking fairly and speaking correctly  .
regan goneril and your large speeches may your deeds approve  , that good effects may spring from words of love  .
regan goneril and you two  , i hope your actions carry out your grand promises of love  , so that big words can bring big results  .
thus kent  , o princes  , bids you all adieu  .
farewell to all of you  .
he 'll shape his old course in a country new  .
i 'll carry on my old life in a new land  .
here 's france and burgundy  , my noble lord  .
here are the rulers of france and burgundy  , my lord  .
my lord of burgundy  .
my lord the ruler of burgundy  , i 'll speak to you first  .
we first address towards you  , who with this king hath rivaled for our daughter  .
you 've been competing with this king for my daughter  .
what in the least will you require in present dower with her or cease your quest of love  ?
what 's the least that you will settle for as a
most royal majesty  , i crave no more than hath your highness offered  .
your highness  , i want nothing more than what you 've already offered  .
nor will you tender less  .
i know you 'll offer nothing less than that  .
i know no answer  .
i do n't know what to say  .
go to  , go to  .
enough  .
better thou hadst not been born than not t ' have pleased me better  .
it would 've been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did  .
is it no more but this a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do  ?
you mean this is the whole problem  , that she is shy and has n't said everything she means to say and do  ?
my lord of burgundy  , what say you to the lady  ?
my lord of burgundy  , what do you have to say to this lady  ?
love 's not love when it is mingled with regards that stands aloof from th ' entire point  .
love 's not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters  .
will you have her  ?
will you marry her  ?
she is herself a dowry  .
she herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be  .
lear royal king  , give but that portion which yourself proposed  , and here i take cordelia by the hand  , duchess of burgundy  .
lear king  , just give me the dowry you promised me  , and i 'll make cordelia the duchess of burgundy right away  .
peace be with burgundy  .
peace to you  , my lord of burgundy  .
since that respects and fortunes are his love  , i shall not be his wife  .
since you love money and power so much  , i wo n't be your wife  .
fairest cordelia  , that art most rich being poor  , most choice forsaken  , and most loved despised  !
beautiful cordelia  , you 're all the richer now that you 're poor  .
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon  , be it lawful i take up what 's cast away  .
you 're more valuable now that you 're rejected and more loved now that you 're hated  .
gods  , gods  !
i 'll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now  , if it 's okay that i 'm picking up what others have thrown away  .
't is strange that from their cold'st neglect my love should kindle to inflamed respect  .
it 's so strange that in neglecting you so cruelly  , the gods have made me love you so dearly  .
thy dowerless daughter  , king  , thrown to my chance  , is queen of us  , of ours  , and our fair france  .
king  , the daughter you 've rejected is now mine  , as queen of france  .
not all the dukes of waterish burgundy can buy this unprized precious maid of me  .
no duke of spineless burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now  .
bid them farewell  , cordelia  , though unkind  .
say goodbye to them  , cordelia  , even though they 've been unkind to you  .
thou losest here  , a better where to find  .
you 'll find a much better place in france than what you 're giving up here  .
bid farewell to your sisters  .
say goodbye to your sisters  .
prescribe not us our duty  .
do n't tell us what our duty is  .
let your study be to content your lord  , who hath received you at fortune 's alms  .
you should focus instead on pleasing your husband  , who 's taken you in as an act of charity  .
you have obedience scanted  , and well are worth the want that you have wanted  .
you 've failed to obey your father and you deserve to be deprived of everything that 's been taken away from you  .
come  , my fair cordelia  .
come with me  , my dear cordelia  .
sister  , it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both  .
sister  , i have a lot to say about things that concern us both  .
i think our father will hence tonight  .
i think that our father will leave here tonight  .
that 's most certain  , and with you  .
yes  , i 'm sure he will to stay with you  .
next month with us  .
next month he 'll stay with us  .
't is the infirmity of his age  .
he 's going senile  .
yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself  .
but then again he 's never really understood his own feelings very well  .
the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash  .
yes  , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life  .
then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long - engrafted condition  , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them  .
now that he 's old  , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws  , which have turned into deep - rooted habits  , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age  .
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent 's banishment  .
we 'll probably witness many more outbursts from him  , like banishing kent  .
there is further compliment of leave - taking between france and him  .
there 's still the king of france 's farewell ceremony  .
pray you  , let 's sit together  .
let 's put our heads together  .
if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears  , this last surrender of his will but offend us  .
if our father continues to use his authority as usual  , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us  .
we shall further think on 't  .
we 'll have to think about it carefully  .
we must do something  , and i ' th ' heat  .
we have to strike while the iron 's hot  .
kent banished thus  ?
kent 's been banished just like that  ?
and france in choler parted  ?
and the king of france gone in a huff  ?
and the king gone tonight  , prescribed his power confined to exhibition  ?
and king lear 's abdicated his authority  , making his kingship a ceremonial title only  ?
all this done upon the gad  ?
all this so suddenly  ?
edmund  , how now  ?
edmund  , what 's going on  ?
what news  ?
what 's the news  ?
so please your lordship  , none  .
no news  , my lord  .
why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter  ?
why are you hiding that letter  ?
i know no news  , my lord  .
i do n't have any news to report  , my lord  .
what paper were you reading  ?
what 's that paper you were reading  ?
nothing  , my lord  .
it 's nothing  , my lord  .
no  ?
no  ?
what needed  , then  , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket  ?
then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry  ?
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself  .
if it were nothing  , you would n't need to hide it  .
let 's see  .
let 's see it  .
come  , if it be nothing  , i shall not need spectacles  .
come on  , if it 's nothing  , i wo n't need glasses to read it  .
i beseech you  , sir  , pardon me  .
please  , sir  , i beg you  .
it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o'er - read  .
it 's a letter from my brother that i have n't finished reading yet  .
and for so much as i have perused  , i find it not fit for your o'erlooking  .
but judging from the bit i have read  , it 's not fit for you to see  .
give me the letter  , sir  .
give me that letter  , sir  .
i shall offend  , either to detain or give it  .
now i 'll offend you whether i give it to you or not  .
the contents  , as in part i understand them  , are to blame  .
the problem is in what the letter says  , as far as i can tell  .
let 's see  , let 's see  .
let 's see  , let 's see  .
i hope  , for my brother 's justification  , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue  .
i hope for my brother 's sake that he just wrote it to test my honor  .
this policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times  , keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness can not relish them  .
the custom of respecting the elderly makes it hard for the young and healthy to live well  , and keeps us without our inheritance until we are so old we ca n't enjoy our happiness anyway  .
i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny  , who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered  .
the power of the elderly is starting to feel like a silly and foolish slavery to me  , and they only enjoy that power because we let them have it  .
it was not brought me  , my lord  .
nobody delivered it  , my lord  .
there 's the cunning of it  .
that 's what 's clever about it  .
i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet  .
it was tossed into the window of my room  .
you know the character to be your brother 's  ?
you 're sure the handwriting is your brother 's  ?
if the matter were good  , my lord  , i durst swear it were his  .
if he 'd written nice things  , i 'd swear yes right away  .
but in respect of that  , i would fain think it were not  .
but as it stands  , i wish i could believe it was n't  .
it is his  .
but it is his handwriting  ?
it is his hand  , my lord  , but i hope his heart is not in the contents  .
it 's his handwriting  , my lord  , but i hope he did n't mean what he wrote  .
has he never before sounded you in this business  ?
has he ever tested out these ideas on you before  ?
never  , my lord  .
never  , my lord  .
but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that  , sons at perfect age and fathers declined  , the father should be as ward to the son  , and the son manage his revenue  .
but i 've often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining  , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money  .
brutish  !
than a beast  !
go  , sirrah  , seek him  .
go look for him  .
i 'll apprehend him  .
i 'll arrest him  .
abominable villain  !
horrid villain  !
where is he  ?
where is he  ?
think you so  ?
do you think so  ?
he can not be such a monster
he ca n't possibly be such a monster
nor is not  , sure  .
and i 'm sure he is n't  .
mutinies  , in countries discord  , in palaces treason  , and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father  .
break out  , civil war erupts  , kings are betrayed  , and the bond between father and son snaps  .
this villain of mine comes under the prediction there 's son against father  .
this wicked son of mine confirms the prediction son against father  .
the king falls from bias of nature there 's father against child  .
the king acts unnaturally father against child  .
we have seen the best of our time  .
we 've seen the best our age has to offer  .
machinations  , hollowness  , treachery  , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves  .
conspiracies  , fakery  , betrayal  , and disorder are all that 's left until we die  .
find out this villain  , edmund  .
find out what this villainous edgar is thinking  , edmund  .
it shall lose thee nothing  .
you wo n't lose any respect  .
do it carefully  .
just do it carefully  .
and the noble and true - hearted kent banished  , his offense honesty  !
and to think that the noble and loyal kent has been banished  , for the crime of telling the truth  !
't is strange  , strange  .
it 's strange  , strange  .
and pat on 's cue he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy  .
and  , speak of the devil  , here he comes  , right on cue  .
my cue is villainous melancholy  , with a sigh like tom o ' bedlam  .
i 've got to play the role and sigh like a poor beggar  .
oh  , these eclipses do portend these divisions  !
oh  , these eclipses predict such disorder  .
fa  , sol  , la  , mi  .
fa  , sol  , la  , mi  .
how now  , brother edmund  ?
hello  , brother edmund  .
what serious contemplation are you in  ?
what are you thinking about so seriously  ?
do you busy yourself about that  ?
are you spending your valuable time on that  ?
i promise you  , the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent  , death  , dearth  , dissolutions of ancient amities  , divisions in state  , menaces and maledictions against king and nobles  , needless diffidences  , banishment of friends  , dissipation of cohorts  , nuptial breaches  , and i know not what  .
oh  , i assure you the things he writes about are wretched things like divisions between parents and children  , death  , famine  , broken friendships  , political rebellion  , treason against the king and noblemen  , exiled friends  , dissolved armies  , adultery  , and i do n't know what else  .
how long have you been a sectary astronomical  ?
how long have you believed in astrology  ?
come  , come  .
come on  .
when saw you my father last  ?
when was the last time you saw my father  ?
why  , the night gone by  .
why  , last night  .
spake you with him  ?
did you speak to him  ?
ay  , two hours together  .
yes  , we talked for a couple of hours  .
parted you in good terms  ?
did you leave on good terms  ?
found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance  ?
did he express any dissatisfaction with you  , either in his words or his face  ?
none at all  .
no  , none at all  .
bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him  .
try to remember how you might have offended him  , and try to avoid spending time with him until his anger has cooled a little  .
and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure  , which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay  .
right now he 's so angry that even if he harmed you physically  , he 'd still be raging  .
some villain hath done me wrong  .
some villain has told lies about me  .
that 's my fear  .
that 's what i 'm afraid of  .
i pray you  , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower  .
i suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little  .
and as i say  , retire with me to my lodging  , from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak  .
in the meantime  , come home with me  , and when the time is right i 'll take you to talk to him  .
pray ye  , go  .
please go  .
there 's my key  .
here 's my key  .
if you do stir abroad  , go armed  .
if you go outside  , arm yourself  .
armed  , brother  ?
arm myself  ?
shall i hear from you anon  ?
will i hear from you soon  ?
i do serve you in this business  .
i 'll help you through this business  .
a credulous father  , and a brother noble whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none  , on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy  .
a gullible father and a brother who 's so innocent that he ca n't suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him these are the two fools i need for my plan to work  .
i see the business  .
i know exactly how to proceed  .
let me  , if not by birth  , have lands by wit  .
if i ca n't have an estate by birthright  , then i 'll get it by being clever  .
all with me 's meet that i can fashion fit  .
any trick that works is good for me  .
did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool  ?
did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool  ?
ay  , madam  .
yes  , ma'am  .
by day and night he wrongs me  .
he constantly offends me  .
every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds  .
every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge  .
i 'll not endure it  .
i wo n't stand for it  .
his knights grow riotous  , and himself upbraids us on every trifle  .
his knights are getting out of control  , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail  .
when he returns from hunting  , i will not speak with him  .
when he comes back from hunting  , i 'm not going to speak to him  .
say i am sick  .
tell him i 'm sick  .
if you come slack of former services  , you shall do well  .
and if you 're not as attentive in serving him as you used to be  , that 'll be good  .
the fault of it i 'll answer  .
i 'll take responsibility for it  .
he 's coming  , madam  .
he 's coming  , ma'am  .
i hear him  .
i hear him  .
very well  , madam  .
very well  , ma'am  .
and let his knights have colder looks among you  .
and make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights  .
what grows of it  , no matter  .
do n't worry about the consequences  .
advise your fellows so  .
tell your men as much  .
i would breed from hence occasions  , and i shall  , that i may speak  .
i want this to provoke confrontations  , so i can give him a piece of my mind  .
i 'll write straight to my sister to hold my very course  .
i 'll write to my sister and tell her my plans  .
go  , prepare for dinner  .
now go  , set up for dinner  .
let me not stay a jot for dinner  .
do n't make me wait for dinner even a moment  .
go get it ready  .
get it ready immediately  .
kent how now  , what art thou  ?
kent well now  , who are you  ?
a man  , sir  .
a man  , sir  .
what dost thou profess  ?
what 's your profession  ?
what wouldst thou with us  ?
what do you want from me  ?
what art thou  ?
but who are you  ?
a very honest - hearted fellow  , and as poor as the king  .
an honest guy who 's as poor as the king  .
if thou beest as poor for a subject as he 's for a king  , thou'rt poor enough  .
if you 're as poor a subject as he is a king  , you definitely are poor  .
what wouldst thou  ?
what do you want  ?
service  .
to work as a servant  .
who wouldst thou serve  ?
who do you want to work for  ?
you  .
you  .
dost thou know me  , fellow  ?
do you know me  ?
what 's that  ?
what do you see in my face  ?
authority  .
authority  .
what services canst thou do  ?
what work can you do  ?
i can keep honest counsel  , ride  , run  , mar a curious tale in telling it  , and deliver a plain message bluntly  .
i can be discreet in honorable matters  , ride a horse  , run  , tell a good story badly  , and deliver a plain message bluntly  .
that which ordinary men are fit for  , i am qualified in  .
i 'm good at everything that ordinary men can do  .
and the best of me is diligence  .
the best thing about me is that i 'm hardworking  .
how old art thou  ?
how old are you  ?
not so young  , sir  , to love a woman for singing  , nor so old to dote on her for anything  .
not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well  , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason  .
i have years on my back forty - eight  .
i 'm forty - eight  .
you  , you  , sirrah  , where 's my daughter  ?
you  , sir  , where 's my daughter  ?
so please you
i beg your pardon  , sir
what says the fellow there  ?
what did that guy say  ?
call the clotpoll back  .
call the numbskull back in here  .
where 's my fool  , ho  ?
where 's my fool  ?
i think the world 's asleep  .
you 'd think everyone was asleep  .
how now  ?
so what 's going on  ?
where 's that mongrel  ?
where 's that dog  ?
he says  , my lord  , your daughter is not well  .
he says your daughter 's not feeling well  , my lord  .
why came not the slave back to me when i called him  .
why did n't the jerk come back to me when i called him  ?
sir  , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not  .
sir  , he told me quite bluntly that he did n't feel like it  .
he would not  ?
did n't feel like it  ?
my lord  , i know not what the matter is  , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont  .
my lord  , i do n't know what 's going on  , but it seems to me that your highness is n't being treated as politely as before  .
there 's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also  , and your daughter  .
the servants  , the duke  , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly  .
ha  !
huh  !
sayest thou so  ?
do you really mean that  ?
i beseech you pardon me  , my lord  , if i be mistaken for my duty can not be silent when i think your highness wronged  .
please forgive me if i 'm mistaken  , my lord but i ca n't keep quiet when i think you 're being insulted  .
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception  .
no  , you 're just reminding me of something i 've also noticed  .
i have perceived a most faint neglect of late  , which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness  .
i 've felt neglected recently  , but i decided that it was more likely that i was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind  .
i will look further into 't  .
i 'll look into it further  .
but where 's my fool  ?
but where 's my fool  ?
i have not seen him this two days  .
i have n't seen him for two days  .
since my young lady 's going into france  , sir  , the fool hath much pined away  .
ever since cordelia left for france  , sir  , the fool has been depressed  .
no more of that  .
let 's not talk about it  .

i 've noticed it myself  .

for taking one 's part that 's out of favor  .
for standing up for this unpopular king  .
nay  , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits  , thou'lt catch cold shortly  .
no  , if you ca n't adjust to political changes  , you 'll suffer for it  .
there  , take my coxcomb  .
there  , take my fool 's cap  .
why  , this fellow has banished two on 's daughters  , and did the third a blessing against his will  .
this guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to  .
if thou follow him  , thou must needs wear my coxcomb  .
if you work for him  , you 're a fool and should wear a fool 's cap  .
how now  , nuncle  ?
so how 's it going  , uncle  ?
would i had two coxcombs and two daughters  .
i wish i had two fool 's caps and two daughters  .
why  , my boy  ?
why  , my boy  ?
if i gave them all my living  , i 'd keep my coxcombs myself  .
if i gave them all i own  , i 'd have two fool 's caps for myself  .
there 's mine  .
here 's mine  .
beg another of thy daughters  .
ask your daughters for another one  .
take heed  , sirrah the whip  .
watch out  , boy remember i can whip you  .
a pestilent gall to me  !
a constant pain to me  !
sirrah  , i 'll teach thee a speech  .
i 'll recite something for you  , guy  .
do  .
yes  , do that  .
then 't is like the breath of an unfee 'd lawyer  .
in that case it 's like the words of an unpaid lawyer  .
you gave me nothing for 't  .
you paid me nothing for it  .
can you make no use of nothing  , nuncle  ?
ca n't you make any use of nothing  , uncle  ?
why no  , boy  .
why  , no  , boy  .
nothing can be made out of nothing  .
nothing can be made out of nothing  .
kent prithee  , tell him so much the rent of his land comes to  .
kent please tell him that his income is nothing  , now that he 's given his lands away  .
he will not believe a fool  .
he wo n't believe a fool  .
a bitter fool  .
you 're a bitter fool  .
dost thou know the difference  , my boy  , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool  ?
do you know the difference  , my boy  , between a bitter fool and a sweet one  ?
no  , lad  .
no  , son  .
teach me  .
tell me  .
dost thou call me fool  , boy  ?
are you calling me a fool  , boy  ?
this is not altogether fool  , my lord  .
this is n't entirely a joke  , your highness  .
no  , faith  , lords and great men will not let me  .
no  .
if i had a monopoly out  , they would have part on 't  .
i wish i could be a complete joker but so many lords and important men are also playing fools that i ca n't have a monopoly on it  .
and ladies too they will not let me have all fool to myself  ; they 'll be snatching  .
ladies too they 're always snatching away my role as the biggest fool  .
give me an egg  , nuncle  , and i 'll give thee two crowns  .
uncle  , give me an egg  , and i 'll give you two crowns  .
what two crowns shall they be  ?
which two crowns would those be  ?
why after i have cut the egg i ' th ' middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg  .
well  , when i cut the egg in half and eat the whites  , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns  .
when thou clovest thy crown i ' th ' middle  , and gavest away both parts  , thou borest thy ass o ' th ' back o'er the dirt  .
when you cut your own crown and kingdom in half and gave away both parts  , you were as foolish as the old man in the old story who carries his donkey on his back instead of letting the donkey carry him  .
thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away  .
you did n't have much brains inside the bald crown of your head when you gave away the gold crown of your kingdom  .
if i speak like myself in this  , let him be whipped that first finds it so  .
if i 'm telling the truth like a fool in saying all this  , whip the first person who thinks i sound foolish  .
when were you wont to be so full of songs  , sirrah  ?
when did you become so fond of singing  , boy  ?
i have used it  , nuncle  , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers  .
i 've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power  .
for when thou gavest them the rod  , and put'st down thine own breeches  , prithee  , nuncle  , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie  .
that 's when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down  , please  , uncle  , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie  .
i would fain learn to lie  .
i want to learn how to lie  .
an you lie  , sirrah  , we 'll have you whipped  .
if you lie  , boy  , we 'll have you whipped  .
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are  .
i 'm amazed how similar you and your daughters are  .
they 'll have me whipped for speaking true  , thou'lt have me whipped for lying  , and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace  .
they want to whip me for telling the truth  , you want to whip me for lying  , and sometimes i 'm even whipped for keeping quiet  .
i had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool  .
i 'd rather be anything besides a fool  .
and yet i would not be thee  , nuncle  .
and yet i would n't want to be you  , uncle  .
thou hast pared thy wit o ' both sides and left nothing i ' th ' middle  .
when you gave away pieces of your kingdom  , it 's as if you cut off pieces on both sides of your brain and left nothing in the middle  .
here comes one o ' the parings  .
here comes the owner of one piece  .
how now  , daughter  ?
what 's going on  , daughter  ?
what makes that frontlet on  ?
why are you frowning like that  ?
methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown  .
i think you 've been frowning too much recently  .
for you know  , nuncle  , the hedge - sparrow fed the cuckoo so long  , that it 's had it head bit off by it young  .
you know  , uncle  , a sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow 's head off  .
so out went the candle and we were left darkling  .
so the candle went out and now we 're all in the dark  .

are you my daughter  ?
lear 's shadow  .
you 're lear 's shadow  .
which they will make an obedient father  .

call my train together  .
call my knights together  .
degenerate bastard  , i 'll not trouble thee  .
i wo n't bother you any more  , you monstrous bastard  .
yet have i left a daughter  .
you 're not really my daughter  , but i still have one daughter left  .
you strike my people  , and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters  .
you hit my servants  , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants  .
woe that too late repents  !
you 'll be sorry later  , but it 'll be too late  .
albany o sir  , are you come  ?
albany oh  , sir  , are you here now  ?

please  , sir  , be patient  .
my lord  , i am guiltless  , as i am ignorant  , of what hath moved you  .
my lord  , i have no idea what 's upset you  , but whatever it is  , i had nothing to do with it  .
now gods that we adore  , whereof comes this  ?
dear gods in heaven  , what 's the reason for this  ?
what  , fifty of my followers at a clap  ?

what are you talking about  , sir  ?
do you mark that  , my lord  ?
did you hear that  ?
i can not be so partial  , goneril  , to the great love i bear you
goneril  , you know how much i love you  , but still i have to say
well  , you may fear too far  .
you may be exaggerating the risks  .
safer than trust too far  .
that 's better than exaggerating our trust  .
let me still take away the harms i fear  , not fear still to be taken  .
it 's always better to get rid of what you 're scared of than to be afraid  .
i know his heart  .
i know how his mind works  .
what he hath uttered i have writ my sister  .
i 've written to my sister telling her everything he 's said  .

i wo n't sleep until i 've delivered your letter  , my lord  .
if a man 's brains were in 's heels  , were 't not in danger of kibes  ?
if a man 's brain were in his feet  , would n't it be susceptible to frostbite  ?

in that case  , cheer up  .
thy wit shall ne'er go slipshod  .

your other daughter regan will treat you kindly  , you 'll see  .

why  , what canst thou tell  , my boy  ?
and what do you know  , boy  ?

thou canst tell why one 's nose stands i ' th ' middle on 's face  ?
do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person 's face  ?
no  .

why  , to keep one 's eyes of either side 's nose  , that what a man can not smell out  , he may spy into  .
why  , to keep the eyes on the sides  , so that you can see anything that you ca n't sniff out  .
i did her wrong

the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason  .
there 's a nice reason why the constellation pleiades has only seven stars in it  .
because they are not eight  ?
because it does n't have eight  ?
yes indeed  .
that 's right  .
thou wouldst make a good fool  .
you 'd make a good fool  .

have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two dukes of cornwall and albany  ?
you have n't heard of the war brewing between the dukes of cornwall and albany  ?
not a word  .
not a word  .
you may do then in time  .
you may hear about it soon  .
fare you well  , sir  .
goodbye  , sir  .
my father watches  .
father is on the lookout  .
o sir  , fly this place  .
get out of here quickly  !
intelligence is given where you are hid  .
it has leaked out that you 're hiding here  .
you have now the good advantage of the night  .
if you leave now  , you can take advantage of the darkness and sneak away  .
have you not spoken 'gainst the duke of cornwall aught  ?
you have n't said anything against the duke of cornwall  , have you  ?
he 's coming hither now  , i ' th ' night  , i ' th ' haste  , and regan with him  .
he 's rushing on his way here right now  , and regan 's with him  .
have you nothing said upon his party 'gainst the duke of albany  ?
have you said anything against cornwall or albany  ?
advise yourself  .
think about it  .
now edmund  , where 's the villain  ?
edmund  , where 's your wicked brother  ?
but where is he  ?
but where is he  ?
look  , sir  , i bleed  .
look  , sir  , i 'm bleeding  .
where is the villain  , edmund  ?
where is the villain  , edmund  ?
fled this way  , sir  , when by no means he could
he ran out that way  , sir  , when he could n't
pursue him  , ho  !
follow him  , now  !
go after  .
go  .
by no means what  ?
when he could n't what  ?
by his authority i will proclaim it that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks  , bringing the murderous coward to the stake  .
justice will be rewarded  .
he that conceals him  , death  .
whoever helps edgar hide will die  .
how now  , my noble friend  ?
how are you  , my friend  ?
since i came hither  , which i can call but now  , i have heard strange news  .
ever since i arrived here  , just now  , i 've been hearing strange rumors  .
if it be true  , all vengeance comes too short which can pursue th ' offender  .
if they 're true  , no punishment is harsh enough for the criminal  .
how dost  , my lord  ?
how are you  , my lord  ?
o madam  , my old heart is cracked  , it 's cracked  .
oh  , madam  , my old heart is broken  , broken  .
what  , did my father 's godson seek your life  ?
did my father 's godson try to kill you  ?
he whom my father named  , your edgar  ?
the one whom my father named  , your son edgar  ?
o  , lady  , lady  , shame would have it hid  .
oh  , my lady  , i 'm ashamed to admit it  .
was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father  ?
was n't he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father  ?
i know not  , madam  .
i do n't know  , madam  .
't is too bad  , too bad  .
oh  , it 's too terrible  .
yes  , madam  , he was of that consort  .
to answer your question  , ma'am yes  , he was friendly with those knights  .
no marvel then  , though he were ill affected  .
then it 's no surprise they had a bad influence on him  .
't is they have put him on the old man 's death  , to have th ' expense and spoil of his revenues  .
they probably put him up to killing old man gloucester to get his money  .
i have this present evening from my sister been well informed of them and with such cautions that if they come to sojourn at my house i 'll not be there  .
tonight i received a letter from my sister telling me all about them and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house  .
nor i  , assure thee  , regan  .
and i wo n't be there either  .
edmund  , i hear that you have shown your father a childlike office  .
edmund  , i 'm told you 've acted like a true son to your father  .
it was my duty  , sir  .
i just did my duty  , sir  .
he did bewray his practice  , and received this hurt you see striving to apprehend him  .
he exposed edgar 's murderous plot  , and was wounded  , as you see there  , when trying to apprehend him  .
is he pursued  ?
are your men searching for him  ?
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
if he be taken  , he shall never more be feared of doing harm  .
if he 's caught  , he 'll never make trouble for anyone again  .
make your own purpose how in my strength you please  .
feel free to use my authority however you wish in order to apprehend him  .
for you  , edmund  , whose virtue and obedience doth this instant so much commend itself  , you shall be ours  .
as for you  , edmund  , you 've been so loyal and virtuous throughout this whole business  .
natures of such deep trust we shall much need  .
i 'd like you to work for me  .
you we first seize on  .
i need people as trustworthy as you  .
i shall serve you  , sir  , truly  , however else  .
i 'll always be loyal to you  , sir  .
cornwall for him i thank your grace  .
cornwall thank you  , my lord  , for your kindness to edmund  .
you know not why we came to visit you
you do n't know why we came to visit you
i serve you  , madam  .
i 'm at your service  , madam  .

please  , sir  , be kind to me and tell me  .
i love thee not  .
i wo n't be kind to you  .
why  , then  , i care not for thee  .
in that case  , i do n't much care for you either  .
if i had thee in lipsbury pinfold  , i would make thee care for me  .
if i could get my hands on you  , i 'd make you care  .
why dost thou use me thus  ?
why are you talking to me like this  ?
i know thee not  .
i do n't even know you  .
fellow  , i know thee  .
ah  , but i know you  .
what dost thou know me for  ?
who am i then  ?
why  , what a monstrous fellow art thou  , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee  !
what an ogre you are to slander someone you do n't know  , and who does n't know you  !
away  !
get away from me  !
i have nothing to do with thee  .
i 've got nothing to do with you  .
draw  , you rascal  .

you come here with letters against the king  , and you take his conceited daughter 's side against his royal highness  .

he dies that strikes again  .
the next person to strike again dies  .
what is the matter  ?
what 's going on here  ?
the messengers from our sister and the king  .
these are the messengers from my sister and the king  .
what is your difference  ?
what are you fighting about  ?
speak  .
tell me  .
i am scarce in breath  , my lord  .
i 'm out of breath  , sir  .
thou art a strange fellow  .
that 's an odd thing to say  .
a tailor make a man  ?
how can a tailor make a person  ?
ay  , a tailor  , sir  .
definitely a tailor  , sir  .
a stone - cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o ' th ' trade  .
a sculptor or a painter could n't have screwed him up as bad as that  , even as an apprentice  .
this ancient ruffian  , sir  , whose life i have spared at suit of his gray beard
this old ruffian here  , whom i did n't kill because he 's so old
thou whoreson zed  , thou unnecessary letter  !
you useless bastard you 're like the letter z  , a totally unnecessary addition to the alphabet  .
my lord  , if you will give me leave  , i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him  .
my lord  , please let me grind this lumpy lowlife into a powder and use it to plaster up the bathroom walls  .
spare my gray beard  , you wagtail  ?
you did n't kill me because i 'm so old  , you fawning dog  ?
peace  , sirrah  !
calm down  .
you beastly knave  , know you no reverence  ?
do n't you have any manners  , you savage  ?
yes  , sir  , but anger hath a privilege  .
yes  , sir  , but not when i 'm enraged  .
why art thou angry  ?
why are you enraged  ?
why  , art thou mad  , old fellow  ?
are you insane  , old man  ?
kent how fell you out  ?
kent what did you start quarreling over  ?
say that  .
just tell us  .
no contraries hold more antipathy than i and such a knave  .
i could n't hate that jerk over there any more than i do  .
why dost thou call him knave  ?
why are you calling him a jerk  ?
what 's his offense  ?
what did he do to you  ?
his countenance likes me not  .
i do n't like his face  .
no more perchance does mine  , nor his  , nor hers  .
but maybe you do n't like mine  , or his  , or hers either  .
sir  , in good faith  , or in sincere verity  , under th ' allowance of your great aspect  , whose influence  , like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering phoebus ' front
dearest  , kindest  , most honorable sir  , may i say  , with your esteemed approval  , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun - god phoebus  , that
what mean'st by this  ?
what do you mean by that  ?
to go out of my dialect  , which you discommend so much  .
i tried to stop speaking plainly  , since you dislike plain speech so much  .
i know  , sir  , i am no flatterer  .
sir  , i know i 'm not a flatterer  .
he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave  , which for my part i will not be  , though i should win your displeasure to entreat me to 't  .
the guy who tricked you with plain language was just a plain crook which i 'm not  , however much i may displease you by not being one  .
oswald what was th ' offense you gave him  ?
oswald how did you offend him  ?
none of these rogues and cowards but ajax is their fool  .
these cowards manage to make fools of brave men  .
fetch forth the stocks  , ho  !
bring out the  !
you stubborn ancient knave  , you reverend braggart  , we 'll teach you  .
we 'll teach you  , you stubborn old bastard  , you arrogant show - off  .
sir  , i am too old to learn  .
sir  , i 'm too old to be taught anything  .
call not your stocks for me  .
do n't put me in the stocks  .
i serve the king  , on whose employment i was sent to you  .
i serve the king  , who sent me here  .
you shall do small respect  , show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master  , stocking his messenger  .
if you put me in the stocks you 'll insult him both as a king and as a man  .
fetch forth the stocks  !
bring out the stocks  !
as i have life and honor  , there shall he sit till noon  .
i swear on my life and honor  , he 'll sit here in the stocks until noon  .
till noon  ?
only until noon  , my lord  ?
till night  , my lord  , and all night too  .
no  , the whole day  , and all night too  .
why  , madam  , if i were your father 's dog  , you should not use me so  .
ma'am  , you would n't treat me like this if i were your father 's dog  .
sir  , being his knave  , i will  .
but since you 're his scoundrel servant  , i will  .
this is a fellow of the selfsame color our sister speaks of  .
this guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about  .
come  , bring away the stocks  !
come on  , bring in the stocks  , now  !
let me beseech your grace not to do so  .
i beg you not to do this  , my lord  .
his fault is much  , and the good king his master will check him for 't  .
he 's done wrong  , and his master the king will punish him for it  .
your purposed low correction is such as basest and contemned'st wretches for pilferings and most common trespasses are punished with  .
but the kind
i 'll answer that  .
i 'll take responsibility for that  .
my sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abused  , assaulted for following her affairs  .
my sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders  .
put in his legs  .
put his legs in the stocks  .
gloucester come  , my good lord  , away  .
gloucester let 's go  , my lord  .
i am sorry for thee  , friend  .
i 'm sorry  , my friend  .
't is the duke 's pleasure  , whose disposition  , all the world well knows  , will not be rubbed nor stopped  .
the duke always gets it his way  , and everyone knows you ca n't budge him once he 's made up his mind  .
i 'll entreat for thee  .
i 'll try talking to him again  .
pray you do not  , sir  .
please do n't  , sir  .
i have watched and traveled hard  .
i 've been up for a long time and have done a lot of traveling recently  .
some time i shall sleep out  .
this punishment will be a good chance to catch up on my sleep  .
the rest i 'll whistle  .
the rest of the time i 'll whistle to entertain myself  .
a good man 's fortune may grow out at heels  .
even good men have bad luck  .
give you good morrow  .
have a good morning  .
the duke 's to blame in this  .
it 's wrong for the duke to do this  .
'twill be ill taken  .
the king will be angry with him  .
't is strange that they should so depart from home  , and not send back my messenger  .
it 's strange that regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger  .
as i learned  , the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove  .
according to what i heard  , they had no travel plans as of last night  .
lear hail to thee  , noble master  !
lear hail  , noble master  !
ha  !

makest thou this shame thy pastime  ?
are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself  ?
no  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  .
ha  , ha  !
ha  , ha  !
look  , he wears cruel garters  .
that 's a nasty garter belt  .
horses are tied by the heads  , dogs and bears by the neck  , monkeys by the loins  , and men by the legs  .
you tie up horses by their heads  , dogs and bears by their necks  , monkeys by their waists  , and humans by their legs  .
when a man 's overlusty at legs  , then he wears wooden nether - stocks  .
when a person 's prone to wanderlust  , he has to wear wooden socks  , like a chastity belt around his ankles  .
kent what 's he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here  ?
kent who could have misunderstood your assigment so completely as to lock you up like this  ?
it is both he and she  : your son and daughter  .
your daughter and son - in - law  .
no  .
no  .
yes  .
yes  .
no  , i say  .
i 'm telling you no  .
i say yea  .
and i 'm telling you yes  .
no  , no  , they would not  .
no  , no  , they would n't  .
yes  , they have  .
yes  , they have  .
by jupiter  , i swear no  .
by the god jupiter above  , i swear no  .
by juno  , i swear ay  .
by jupiter 's wife juno  , i swear yes  .
they durst not do 't  .
they would n't dare  .
they could not  , would not do 't  .
they could n't  , they would n't  .
't is worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage  .
it 's worse than murder to humiliate a king 's messenger like this  .
resolve me with all modest haste which way thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage  , coming from us  .
tell me as quickly and clearly as you can what you did to deserve this punishment  , or what made them think they could inflict it on you  .
o  , how this mother swells up toward my heart  !
i 'm getting hysterical  .
hysterica passio  , down  , thou climbing sorrow  .
i feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart  .
thy element 's below  .
calm down  , you belong lower down  !
where is this daughter  ?
where is this daughter of mine  ?
with the earl  , sir  , here within  .
inside  , sir  , with the earl  .
follow me not  .
do n't follow me  .
stay here  .
stay here  .
made you no more offense but what you speak of  ?
you did n't do anything else to earn this punishment  ?
none  .
nothing  .
how chance the king comes with so small a train  ?
tell me  , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage  ?
an thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question  , thou'dst well deserved it  .
if they 'd put you in the stocks for asking that question  , you would 've deserved it  .
why  , fool  ?
why  , fool  ?
where learned you this  , fool  ?
where did you learn that song  , fool  ?
not i ' th ' stocks  , fool  .
not in the stocks  , fool  .
deny to speak with me  ?
how can they refuse to speak with me  ?
they are sick  ?
how can they say that they 're sick or exhausted or that they have traveled all night  !
they are weary  ?
?
they have traveled all the night  ?
they 're playing with me  .
mere fetches  , ay  !
these are tricks  .
the images of revolt and flying off  .
this is rebellion  .
fetch me a better answer  .
go ask them again and make them see me this time  .
well  , my good lord  , i have informed them so  .
my lord  , i informed them as much  .
informed them  ?
informed them  ?
dost thou understand me  , man  ?
do you understand what i 'm saying  , man  ?
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
i would have all well betwixt you  .
i just want everything to be all right between you  .
o me  , my heart  , my rising heart  !
oh  , my heart  , my heart is rising into my throat  !
but down  .
stay down  , heart  .
cry to it  , nuncle  , as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i ' th ' paste alive  .
that 's right  , uncle  , talk to your heart  , like the who yelled at the eels she was putting in her pie  .
she knapped 'em o ' th ' coxcombs with a stick and cried  , down  , wantons  , down  !
she hit 'em on the head with a stick and shouted  , down  , you naughty things  , down  !
't was her brother that  , in pure kindness to his horse  , buttered his hay  .
that was the woman whose brother wanted to be nice to his  , and buttered its hay  .
good morrow to you both  .
good morning to you both  .
hail to your grace  .
hail to your majesty  .
i am glad to see your highness  .
i 'm glad to see your highness  .
belovd regan  , thy sister 's naught  .
my dear regan  , your sister 's not worth anything  .
o regan  , she hath tied sharp - toothed unkindness  , like a vulture  , here  .
oh  , regan  , she 's torn me apart with unkindness  , like a vulture  , right here  .
i can scarce speak to thee  .
i can hardly speak  .
thou'lt not believe with how depraved a quality o regan  !
you 'll never believe how monstrously oh  , regan  !
say  , how is that  ?
how do you mean  ?
i can not think my sister in the least would fail her obligation  .
i ca n't believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way  .
if  , sir  , perchance she have restrained the riots of your followers  , 't is on such ground and to such wholesome end as clears her from all blame  .
if she restrained your rowdy knights  , she had such a good reason that you ca n't blame her for it  .
my curses on her  !
i curse her  .
o sir  , you are old  .
sir  , you 're old  .
nature in you stands on the very verge of his confine  .
your life is stretched to its limit  .
you should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself  .
you should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what 's good for you  .
therefore i pray you that to our sister you do make return  .
please go back to goneril 's house  .
say you have wronged her  , sir  .
admit you were wrong  .
ask her forgiveness  ?
apologize  ?
do you but mark how this becomes the house  ?
do you think this kind of thing is appropriate for the royal family  ?
dear daughter  , i confess that i am old  .
dear daughter  , i admit i 'm old  .
age is unnecessary  .
old people are useless  .
on my knees i beg that you 'll vouchsafe me raiment  , bed  , and food  .
i 'm begging you  , on my knees  , to give me food  , clothes  , and a bed  .
good sir  , no more  .
no more  , please  .
these are unsightly tricks  .
these are ugly antics  .
return you to my sister  .
go back to my sister 's  .
never  , regan  .
never  , regan  .
she hath abated me of half my train  , looked black upon me  , struck me with her tongue  , most serpentlike  , upon the very heart  .
she 's sent away half my knights  , glared at me  , and aimed her venomous insults straight at my heart  .
all the stored vengeances of heaven fall on her ingrateful top  !
she and her ingratitude can go to hell  !
strike her young bones  , you taking airs  , with lameness  !
i hope she gets sick and becomes lame  !
fie  , sir  , fie  !
shush  , sir  , please  !
you nimble lightnings  , dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes  !
i hope lightning strikes her in the eyes  !
infect her beauty  , you fen - sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun  , to fall and blister  !
i hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion  !
o the blessed gods  !
oh  , dear gods  !
so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on  .
that 's how you 'll talk about me when you 're in this mood  .
good sir  , to the purpose  .
sir  , let 's get to the point  .
who put my man i ' th ' stocks  ?
who put my messenger in the stocks  ?
what trumpet 's that  ?
what 's that trumpet  ?
this is a slave whose easy borrowed pride dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows  .
this is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for  .
out  , varlet  , from my sight  !
get out of my sight  , scoundrel  !
what means your grace  ?
what do you mean  , your highness  ?
why not by th ' hand  , sir  ?
why should n't she take my hand  , father  ?
how have i offended  ?
how exactly have i offended you  ?
all 's not offense that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so  .
just because a senile man with poor judgment calls something an insult does n't necessarily mean it is one  .
i set him there  , sir  , but his own disorders deserved much less advancement  .
i sent him there  , sir  , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment  .
you  !
you  !
did you  ?
you did it  ?
at your choice  , sir  .
as you wish  , sir  .
now  , i prithee  , daughter  , do not make me mad  .
i beg you  , daughter  , do n't make me crazy  .
i will not trouble thee  , my child  .
i wo n't bother you  .
farewell  .
we 'll never see each other again  .
we 'll no more meet  , no more see one another  .
but you 're still my child  , my flesh and blood or rather you 're a disease in my flesh  , a disease i still have to call my own  .
but yet thou art my flesh  , my blood  , my daughter or rather a disease that 's in my flesh  , which i must needs call mine  .
you 're a pustule  , a sore  , a tumor digesting my bloodline  .
thou art a boil  , a plague - sore or embossd carbuncle in my corrupted blood  .
but i 'll stop rebuking you  .
but i 'll not chide thee  .
you 'll feel shame when the time is right  , and i do n't urge you to be ashamed now  .
let shame come when it will  .
i wo n't beg the gods to punish you  , or caution you to fear their judgment  .
i do not call it  .
become a better
not altogether so  , sir  .
it 's not quite that simple  .
i looked not for you yet  , nor am provided for your fit welcome  .
i was n't expecting you  , and i 'm not ready to receive you  .
give ear  , sir  , to my sister  .
please hear what goneril is saying  .
for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old  , and so but she knows what she does  .
we 're trying to be reasonable while you 're so upset  , and we understand that you 're old  , and but goneril knows what she 's doing  .
is this well spoken now  ?
do you mean what you 've just said  ?
why might not you  , my lord  , receive attendance from those that she calls servants  , or from mine  ?
why could n't you be attended by my servants  , or by regan 's  ?
why not  , my lord  ?
yes  , why not  , my lord  ?
if then they chanced to slack you  , we could control them  .
then if they 're negligent  , we could control them  .
if you will come to me for now i spy a danger i entreat you to bring but five and twenty  .
now that i think about the danger of these knights  , if you come to stay with me  , please bring no more than twenty - five of them with you  .
to no more will i give place or notice  .
i wo n't lodge any more than that under my roof  .
i gave you all
i gave you everything
and in good time you gave it  .
and it was about time too  .
made you my guardians  , my depositaries  , but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number  .
i made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that i could keep a hundred knights of my own  .
what  , must i come to you with five and twenty  , regan  ?
why should i now have to make do with only twenty - five  ?
said you so  ?
regan  , is that what you said  ?
and speak 't again  , my lord  .
yes  , i 'll say it again  , my lord  .
no more with me  .
no more than twenty - five  .
those wicked creatures yet do look well favored when others are more wicked  .
bad people start to look better in comparison with worse people  .
not being the worst stands in some rank of praise  .
not being the worst daughter deserves some praise  , i guess  .
goneril i 'll go with thee  .
goneril i 'll go stay with you  , then  .
thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty  , and thou art twice her love  .
your fifty is twice her twenty - five  , so you must love me twice as much as she does  .
hear me  , my lord  .
hear me out  , my lord  .
what need you five and twenty  , ten  , or five to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you  ?
why do you need twenty - five knights  , or ten  , or even five  , when you 're staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service  ?
what need one  ?
why do you need even one  ?
i have full cause of weeping  , but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws  , or ere i 'll weep  .
i have a good reason to cry  , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before i let myself cry  .
o fool  , i shall go mad  !
oh  , fool  , i 'll go mad  !
let us withdraw  .
let 's go inside  .
'twill be a storm  .
there 's going to be a storm  .
this house is little  .
this is a small house  .
the old man and his people can not be well bestowed  .
there 's no room for the old man and his followers  .
't is his own blame  .
it 's his fault that he 's all worked up like this  .
hath put himself from rest  , and must needs taste his folly  .
he has to pay the price for his foolish actions  .
for his particular i 'll receive him gladly  , but not one follower  .
i 'll be happy to keep him in my house  , but not a single knight  .
so am i purposed  .
that 's what i intend to do too  .
where is my lord of gloucester  ?
where is gloucester  ?
followed the old man forth  .
he followed the old man  .
he is returned  .
here he comes back  .
the king is in high rage  .
the king is enraged  .
whither is he going  ?
where 's he going  ?
he calls to horse  , but will i know not whither  .
he has called for his horse  , but i do n't know where he 's headed  .
't is best to give him way  .
it 's best just to let him go  .
he leads himself  .
he wo n't listen to anyone 's advice  .
gloucester my lord  , entreat him by no means to stay  .
gloucester my lord  , do n't try to persuade him to stay  .
o sir  , to wilful men  , the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters  .
oh  , sir  , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions  .
shut up your doors  .
lock the doors  .
he is attended with a desperate train  .
his attendants are desperate  , violent men  .
and what they may incense him to  , being apt to have his ear abused  , wisdom bids fear  .
i 'm afraid of what they might encourage him to do  , considering the state he 's in  .
shut up your doors  , my lord  .
lock the doors  , my lord  .
't is a wild night  .
it 's a wild night  .
my regan counsels well  .
regan gives good advice  .
come out o ' th ' storm  .
come in out of the storm  .
who 's there  , besides foul weather  ?
who 's there  , aside from this foul weather  ?
one minded like the weather  , most unquietly  .
someone whose mood is as foul as the weather  , very troubled  .
i know you  .
i know you  .
where 's the king  ?
where 's the king  ?
contending with the fretful elements  .
struggling with the wind and rain  .
bids the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the curld water 'bove the main  , that things might change or cease  .
he 's shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea  , or make the sea flood the earth he wants to see the world return to primal chaos  .
tears his white hair  , which the impetuous blasts  , with eyeless rage  , catch in their fury and make nothing of  .
he keeps tearing out his white hair  , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness  .
strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to - and - froconflicting wind and rain  .
small but brave in his surroundings  , he 's trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth  .
this night wherein the cub - drawn bear would couch  , the lion and the belly - pinchd wolf keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs  , and bids what will take all  .
he 's running bareheaded  , calling for the end of the world  , out there on a night like this  , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide  .
but who is with him  ?
but who 's with him  ?
none but the fool  , who labors to outjest his heart - struck injuries  .
nobody but the fool  , who 's trying to soothe the wounds in the king 's heart with jokes  .
sir  , i do know you  , and dare upon the warrant of my note commend a dear thing to you  .
sir  , i know you  , and i trust you enough to share something very important with you  .
there is division  , although as yet the face of it be covered with mutual cunning  , 'twixt albany and cornwall  , who have as who have not that their great stars throned and set high  ?
there 's a feud between albany and cornwall  , although they 've been clever enough to hide it thus far  .
servants  , who seem no less  , which are to france the spies and speculations intelligent of our state  .
like other powerful rulers  , they have servants who are actually french spies in disguise  .
what hath been seen  , either in snuffs and packings of the dukes  , or the hard rein which both of them hath borne against the old kind king  , or something deeper  , whereof perchance these are but furnishings but true it is  .
these spies have noticed something  , perhaps in the squabbles between albany and cornwall  , or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king  , or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems the point is that the king of france has sent troops into our divided kingdom  .
from france there comes a power into this scattered kingdom  , who already  , wise in our negligence  , have secret feet in some of our best ports and are at point to show their open banner  .
some french agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war  .
now to you  .
now this is where you come in  .
if on my credit you dare build so far to make your speed to dover  , you shall find some that will thank you  , making just report of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow the king hath cause to plain  .
if you trust me enough to hurry to dover  , you 'll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king 's suffering  .
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding  , and from some knowledge and assurance offer this office to you  .
i 'm a nobleman  , and i know what i 'm doing in assigning this job to you  .
i will talk further with you  .
let 's discuss it some more  .
gentleman no  , do not  .
gentleman no  , there 's no need  .
for confirmation that i am much more than my outwall  , open this purse and take what it contains  .
to assure you that i am a nobleman in disguise  , here is some money  .
if you shall see cordelia as fear not but you shall show her this ring  .
if you see cordelia as i 'm sure you will show her this ring  .
and she will tell you who that fellow is that yet you do not know  .
she 'll tell you who i am  .
fie on this storm  !
damn this storm  !
i will go seek the king  .
i 'll go find the king  .
give me your hand  .
let me shake your hand  .
have you no more to say  ?
do you have anything else to tell me  ?
o nuncle  , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o ' door  .
oh  , uncle  , it 's better to smile and flatter indoors where it 's dry than get soaked out here  .
good nuncle  , in  , and ask thy daughters blessing  .
please  , uncle  , let 's go in and ask your daughters to forgive you  .
here 's a night pities neither wise man nor fool  .
this storm has no pity for either wise men or fools  .
he that has a house to put 's head in has a good headpiece  .
anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders  .
the codpiece that will house
the guy who finds a place to put his penis before he has a house of his own will wind up dirt poor and covered with lice
no  , i will be the pattern of all patience  .
no  , i 'll be patient  .
i will say nothing  .
i wo n't say a word  .
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?
marry  , here 's grace and a codpiece that 's a wise man and a fool  .
a wise man and a fool  .
lear alas  , sir  , are you here  ?
lear ah  , sir  , you 're here  ?
things that love night love not such nights as these  .
even creatures of the night are n't out tonight in this storm  .
the wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the dark and make them keep their caves  .
the angry skies terrify the animals that usually prowl in the dark  , making them stay in their caves  .
snce i was man  , such sheets of fire  , such bursts of horrid thunder  , such groans of roaring wind and rain i never remember to have heard  .
never in my life have i heard such horrible blasts of thunder  , such a roaring downpour  , such groaning winds  .
man 's nature can not carry th ' affliction nor the fear  .
it 's too trying and terrifying for humans to bear  .
my wits begin to turn  .
i 'm starting to lose my mind  .
fool come on  , my boy  .
fool come on  , my boy  .
how dost  , my boy  ?
how are you  ?
art cold  ?
are you cold  ?
i am cold myself  .
i 'm cold myself  .
kent where is this straw  , my fellow  ?
kent where 's this hut  , man  ?
the art of our necessities is strange that can make vile things precious  .
odd how when you 're desperate  , even shoddy things like this hut can seem precious  .
come  , your hovel  .
show me where that hut is  .
poor fool and knave  , i have one part in my heart that 's sorry yet for thee  .
poor fool  , part of me still feels sorry for you  .
true  , my good boy  .
that 's true  , my good boy  .
come  , bring us to this hovel  .
come on  , take us to that hut  .
alack  , alack  , edmund  , i like not this unnatural dealing  .
oh  , oh  , edmund  , i do n't like this monstrous business  .
when i desire their leave that i might pity him  , they took from me the use of mine own house  , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him  , entreat for him  , nor any way sustain him  .
when asked the duke and duchess of cornwall if i could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm  , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him  , lobby for him  , or support him in any way  .
most savage and unnatural  !
that 's uncivilized and unnatural  !
here is the place  , my lord  .
here 's the hut  , my lord  .
good my lord  , enter  .
please go inside  .
the tyranny of the open night 's too rough for nature to endure  .
the night 's too rough for humans to bear  .
let me alone  .
leave me for a bit  .
good my lord  , enter here  .
my lord  , here is the entrance  .
wilt break my heart  ?
will you break my heart  ?
i had rather break mine own  .
i 'd rather break my own heart  .
good my lord  , enter  .
now please go in  .
thou think'st 't is much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin  .
you think it 's a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin  .
so 't is to thee  .
it 's a big deal to you  .
but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt  .
but whenever you feel a larger pain  , the smaller one disappears  .
thou'dst shun a bear  , but if thy flight lay toward the raging sea thou'dst meet the bear i ' th ' mouth  .
you would run away from a bear  , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean  , you 'd turn around and confront the bear  .
when the mind 's free  , the body 's delicate  .
when your mind is at peace  , your body is sensitive to the elements  .
the tempest in my mind doth from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there filial ingratitude  .
but this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what 's tormenting me how ungrateful my children are  !
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to 't  ?
is n't their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it  ?
but i will punish home  .
but i 'll punish them thoroughly  .
no  , i will weep no more  .
no  , i wo n't cry any more  .
in such a night to shut me out  !
imagine them locking me out on a night like this  !
pour on  , i will endure  .
but let it rain  ; i 'll survive  .
in such a night as this  !
on a night like this  !
o regan  , goneril  , your old kind father  , whose frank heart gave all oh  , that way madness lies  .
oh  , regan  , goneril  , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything oh  , if i think about that i 'll go mad  .
let me shun that  .
i want to avoid that  .
no more of that  .
no more of these thoughts  .
good my lord  , enter here  .
my lord  , please go inside here  .
fathom and half  , fathom and half  !
the water in here is nine feet deep  !
poor tom  !
poor tom  !
come not in here  , nuncle  .
do n't come in here  , uncle  !
here 's a spirit  .
there 's a spirit in here  !
help me  , help me  !
help me  , help me  !
give me thy hand  .
give me your hand  .
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?
a spirit  , a spirit  .
a ghost  , a ghost  !
he says his name 's poor tom  .
he says his name 's poor tom  .
what art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw  ?
who are you  , moaning in the hut like that  ?
come forth  .
come out  .
away  !
go away  !
the foul fiend follows me  !

my son came then into my mind  , and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him  .
he made me think that men are as weak and insignificant as worms  .
i have heard more since  .
i was reminded of my son  , even though i despised my son at that time  .
as flies to wanton boys are we to th ' gods  .
now i know better  .
they kill us for their sport  .
the gods play around with us as cruelly as schoolboys who pull the wings off flies  .
how should this be  ?
what 's going on  ?
bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow  , angering itself and others  .
i hate pretending i 'm a wandering beggar when all i want to do now is comfort my poor father  .
bless thee  , master  !
bless you  , master  .
is that the naked fellow  ?
is that the naked guy  ?
ay  , my lord  .
yes  , my lord  .
then prithee  , get thee gone  .
old man then please go  .
if for my sake thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain i ' th ' way toward dover  , do it for ancient love  .
if you 're willing to do me a favor  , as an old friend  , then catch up to us a mile or two further on the way to dover  , and bring some clothes for this poor beggar  .
and bring some covering for this naked soul  , which i 'll entreat to lead me  .
i 'll ask him to be my guide  .
alack  , sir  , he is mad  .
but sir  , he 's crazy  .
't is the time 's plague when madmen lead the blind  .
it 's the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind  .
do as i bid thee  .
do as i asked you  .
or rather  , do thy pleasure  .
or rather  , do what you feel like doing  .
above the rest  , be gone  .
but above all  , get out of here  .
i 'll bring him the best 'parel that i have  , come on 't what will  .
i 'll bring the crazy beggar the best clothes i have  , no matter what happens  .
sirrah  , naked fellow
hey  , naked guy
poor tom 's a - cold  .
poor tom 's chilly  .
i can not daub it further  .
i ca n't play this role any longer  .
come hither  , fellow  .
come here  , man  .
know'st thou the way to dover  ?
do you know the way to dover  ?
both stile and gate  , horseway and footpath  .
i know it like the back of my hand  , every step of the way  .
poor tom hath been scared out of his good wits  .
poor tom has been scared out of his mind  .
bless thee  , goodman 's son  , from the foul fiend  !
bless you  , good man  , and stay away from the devil  .
five fiends have been in poor tom at once  : of lust  , as obidicut  ; hobbididence  , prince of dumbness  ; mahu  , of stealing  ; modo  , of murder  ; flibbertigibbet  , of mopping and mowing  , who since possesses chambermaids and waiting - women  .
five devils haunted poor tom at the same time  : obidicut  , the devil of lust  ; hobbididence  , the devil of mutes  ; mahu  , the devil of stealing  ; modo  , the devil of murder  ; and flibbertigibbet  , the devil of mockery  , who causes chambermaids to make silly faces  .
so bless thee  , master  .
bless you  , master  .
ay  , master  .
yes  , sir  .
there is a cliff  , whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confind deep  .
there 's a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea  .
bring me but to the very brim of it  , and i 'll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me  .
take me to the edge of it  , and i 'll reward all your troubles with something valuable  .
from that place i shall no leading need  .
once i 'm there  , i wo n't need a guide anymore  .
give me thy arm  .
give me your arm  .
poor tom shall lead thee  .
poor tom will take you there  .
welcome  , my lord  .
welcome  , my lord  .
i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way  .
i 'm surprised my bland husband did n't meet me on the way here  .
now  , where 's your master  ?
where 's your master  ?
yours in the ranks of death  .
i 'm at your service until death  .
my most dear gloucester  !
my dear gloucester  !
madam  , here comes my lord  .
ma'am  , my master 's coming  .
i have been worth the whistle  .
so you finally find me worthy of your attentions  .
no more  .
oh  , shut up  .
the text is foolish  .
your words are idiotic  .
o vain fool  !
you useless fool  !
thou changd and self - covered thing  , for shame  !
shame on you  , warped hag  !
bemonster not thy feature  .
your true demonic features are distorting your body  .
were 't my fitness to let these hands obey my blood  , they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones  .
if i let myself do what i yearn to  , i 'd rip the flesh off your bones  .
howe'er thou art a fiend  , a woman 's shape doth shield thee  .
but i wo n't attack a woman  , even if she is a demon  .
what news  ?
what news do you bring  ?
gloucester 's eyes  ?
gloucester 's eyes  ?
where was his son when they did take his eyes  ?
where was gloucester 's son edmund when they gouged his eyes out  ?
come with my lady hither  .
he was on his way here with your wife  .
he is not here  .
but he is n't here now  .
no  , my good lord  .
no  , my lord  .
i met him back again  .
i met him going back again  .
knows he the wickedness  ?
does he know about this wicked crime  ?
why the king of france is so suddenly gone back know you the reason  ?
do you know why the king of france suddenly went back home  ?
who hath he left behind him general  ?
whom did he leave in charge here  ?
the marshal of france  , monsieur la far  .
the marshal of france  , monsieur la far  .
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief  ?
was queen cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered  ?
o  , then it moved her  ?
so she was moved by it  ?
made she no verbal question  ?
she did n't ask anything  ?
faith  , once or twice she heaved the name of father pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart  , cried  , sisters  , sisters  !
actually  , once or twice she sighed and said  , father  , as if the word were pressing on her chest  .
shame of ladies  , sisters  !
once she exclaimed  , sisters  , sisters  , shame on you  !
kent  , father  , sisters  !
kent  , father  , sisters  !
what  , i ' th ' storm  , i ' th ' night  ?
what  , out in a storm in the middle of the night  ?
let pity not be believed  .
i ca n't believe it  .
there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes  , and clamor moistened  .
the tears fell from her eyes like holy water  .
then away she started to deal with grief alone  .
then she ran away to grieve alone  .
no  .
no  .
was this before the king returned  ?
did this happen before the king of france returned home  ?
no  , since  .
no  , afterward  .
why  , good sir  ?
why  , good sir  ?
a sovereign shame so elbows him  .
he 's too overwhelmed with shame  .
his own unkindness that stripped her from his benediction turned her to foreign casualties  , gave her dear rights to his dog - hearted daughters  .
he remembers how unkind he was to her  , how he disowned her and sent her abroad  , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog - hearted sisters  .
these things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from cordelia  .
all those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from cordelia  .
alack  , poor gentleman  !
oh  , the poor man  !
of albany 's and cornwall 's powers you heard not  ?
have you heard about albany 's and cornwall 's troops  ?

they 're on the march  .
well  , sir  , i 'll bring you to our master lear and leave you to attend him  .
well  , sir  , i 'll take you to lear and have you stay with him a while  .
some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile  .
i have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer  .
when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance  .
when i 've revealed my true identity  , you 'll be glad you took the time to help me out  .
i pray you  , go along with me  .
please come with me  .
alack  , 't is he  .
sadly  , it 's the king that 's missing  .
why  , he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea  , singing aloud  , crowned with rank fumiter and furrow - weeds  , with burdocks  , hemlock  , nettles  , cuckoo - flowers  , darnel  , and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn  .
they saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea  , singing loudly  , wearing a crown of nettles  , thorns  , hemlock  , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields  .
a century send forth  .
send out a hundred soldiers to find him  .
search every acre in the high - grown field  , and bring him to our eye  .
search high and low  , in every acre of the fields  , and bring him here for me to see him  .
what can man 's wisdom in the restoring his bereavd sense  ?
what can human knowledge do to make him sane again  ?
he that helps him take all my outward worth  .
i 'd give all my wealth to whoever can help him  .
all blessed secrets  , all you unpublished virtues of the earth  , spring with my tears  .
then i 'll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow  .
be aidant and remediate in the good man 's distress  .
may they relieve a sick old man 's suffering  .
seek  , seek for him  , lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it  .
go find those herbs for him  , before his madness puts his life in danger  .

we already knew that  .
our preparation stands in expectation of them  .
our forces are ready for them  .
o dear father  , it is thy business that i go about  .
oh  , father  , i 'm taking care of your business  .
therefore great france my mourning and importuned tears hath pitied  .
that 's why the king of france listened to my pleas and tears  .
no blown ambition doth our arms incite  , but love dear love  !
we 're not invading england out of ambition or greed  , but out of love dear love  !
and our aged father 's right  .
and my father 's right to his kingdom  .
soon may i hear and see him  .
i hope i see him and hear him again soon  .
but are my brother 's powers set forth  ?
have my brother - in - law 's troops been mobilized  ?
ay  , madam  .

your sister is the better soldier  .
your sister 's the better soldier of the two  .

my lady charged my duty in this business  .
my lady ordered me to deliver her letter  .
madam  , i had rather
ma'am  , i 'd rather
i know your lady does not love her husband  .
i know your lady goneril does n't love her husband  .
i am sure of that  .
i 'm sure of that  .
and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund  .
and when she was here recently she flirted with edmund and gave him significant glances  .
i know you are of her bosom  .
i know she trusts you and tells you everything  .
i  , madam  ?
me  , ma'am  ?
would i could meet him  , madam  , i should show what party i do follow  .
if i could run into him  , ma'am  , i 'd prove which side i 'm on  .
fare thee well  .
goodbye  .
when shall we come to th ' top of that same hill  ?
when will we get to the top of that cliff  ?
you do climb up it now  .
we 're walking up to the top right now  .
look how we labor  .
see how hard it is to climb  ?
methinks the ground is even  .
the ground feels flat to me  .
no  , truly  .
no  , really  , i do n't  .
why then  , your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes ' anguish  .
then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness  .
so may it be indeed  .
it may be so  .
methinks thy voice is altered  , and thou speak'st in better phrase and matter than thou didst  .
it seems to me that your voice has changed  , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be  .
you 're much deceived  .
you 're mistaken about all that  .
in nothing am i changed but in my garments  .
the only thing different about me is my clothes  .
methinks you 're better spoken  .
i think you 're more articulate  .
diminished to her cock  , her cock a buoy almost too small for sight  .
than its lifeboat  , and its lifeboat looks as small as a tiny buoy  .
the murmuring surge that on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes can not be heard so high  .
up here you ca n't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks  .
i 'll look no more lest my brain turn and the deficient sight topple down headlong  .
i have to stop looking  , or my head will start spinning and i 'll fall  .
set me where you stand  .
lead me to where you 're standing  .
give me your hand  .
give me your hand  .
you are now within a foot of th ' extreme verge  .
you 're now within a foot of the cliff 's edge  .
for all beneath the moon would i not leap upright  .
i would n't try to jump up and down here for anything on earth  .
now fare you well  , good sir  .
goodbye  , good sir  .
with all my heart  .
with all my heart  .
why i do trifle thus with his despair is done to cure it  .
i 'm toying with his despair to cure him of it  .
gone  , sir  .
gone  , sir  .
farewell  .
goodbye  .
and yet i know not how conceit may rob the treasury of life when life itself yields to the theft  .
but i still wonder if it 's possible for his own imagination to kill him  , since he 's so willing to die  .
had he been where he thought  , by this had thought been past  .
if he 'd been standing on the edge of the cliff as he thought  , he 'd be dead right now  .
alive or dead  ?
is he alive or dead  ?
ho you  , sir  , friend  !
hey  , sir  , friend  !
hear you  , sir  ?
can you hear me  ?
speak  .
answer me  .
thus might he pass indeed  .
maybe he passed away after all  .
yet he revives  .
but no  , he 's stirring  .
what are you  , sir  ?
who are you  , sir  ?
away  , and let me die  .
go away and let me die  .
hadst thou been aught but gossamer  , feathers  , air  , so many fathom down precipitating  , thou'dst shivered like an egg  .
even if you were made of feathers and air  , you should 've been smashed in pieces like an egg after falling as far as you just did  .
but thou dost breathe  , hast heavy substance  , bleed'st not  , speak'st  , art sound  .
but your flesh is solid  , your mind is strong  , you 're breathing and talking  , you 're not bleeding  .
ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell  .
you just fell the height of ten ship masts  , straight down  .
thy life 's a miracle  .
it 's a miracle you 're alive  .
speak yet again  .
say something again  .
but have i fall'n  , or no  ?
but did i fall or not  ?
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn  .
you fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff  .
look up a - height  .
look for yourself see the top of the cliff way up there  ?
the shrill - gorged lark so far can not be seen or heard  .
the lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard  .
do but look up  .
just look  .
too well  , too well  .
only too well  .
this is above all strangeness  .
this is beyond weird  .
upon the crown o ' th ' cliff  , what thing was that which parted from you  ?
what was that thing i saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell  ?
a poor unfortunate beggar  .
that was a poor unlucky beggar  .
bear free and patient thoughts  .
cheer up and be at peace  .
but who comes here  ?
but who is that  ?
the safer sense will ne'er accommodate his master thus  .
a sane person would never dress like this  .
no  , they can not touch me for coining  .
no  , they ca n't accuse me of counterfeiting coins  .
i am the king himself  .
i 'm the king himself  .
o thou side - piercing sight  !

i know that voice  .
the trick of that voice i do well remember  .
i recognize something about that voice  .
is 't not the king  ?
is n't that the king  ?
o  , let me kiss that hand  !
oh  , let me kiss his hand  !
let me wipe it first  .
let me wipe it off first  .
it smells of mortality  .
it stinks of death  .
o ruined piece of nature  !
a ruined man  !
this great world shall so wear out to naught  .
this is how the whole world will end up  , worn away to nothing  .

just look at the handwriting  .
were all thy letters suns  , i could not see one  .
if every letter on that page were a sun  , i could n't see even one of them  .
i would not take this from report  .
i would n't believe this if i were n't seeing it with my own eyes  .
it is  , and my heart breaks at it  .
it 's real  , and it breaks my heart  .
read  .
read it  .
oh ho  , are you there with me  ?
oh ho  , is that what you 're getting at  ?
no eyes in your head  , nor no money in your purse  ?
you want money before you 'll read  ?
your eyes are in a heavy case  , your purse in a light  .
no eyes in your head til there 's money in your wallet  ?
yet you see how this world goes  .
your eyes are in a bad way  , your wallet 's empty  , but you understand the ways of the world  .
i see it feelingly  .
i do understand  , by touch  .
ay  , sir  .
yes  , sir  .
o matter and impertinency mixed  !
oh  , wisdom and absurdity mixed up together  !

when we 're born  , we cry because we 've arrived on the stage of life  , like all the other fools  .
this a good block  .
that 's a nice hat you 've got there  .
it were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt  .
how ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt  .

why  , this would make a man a man of salt  , to use his eyes for garden water - pots  , ay  , and laying autumn 's dust  .
that would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears  .

let our reciprocal vows be remembered  .
you have many chances to kill albany  .
you have many opportunities to cut him off  .
if you have the strength of will to do it  , you 'll have many opportunities  .
if your will want not  , time and place will be fruitfully offered  .
if he returns in triumph  , then all is lost  .
there is nothing done if he return the conqueror  .
i 'll be his prisoner  , and his bed will be my prison  .
then am i the prisoner and his bed my gaol  , from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me  , and supply the place for your labor  .
help me escape him  , and you can take his place  .
your wife  , so i would say affectionate servant  , and for you her own for venture  , goneril  .
your i wish i could say wife loving servant  , who is ready to love you  , goneril  .

a plot upon her virtuous husband 's life  , and the exchange my brother  !
she 's plotting against the life of her virtuous husband  , and wants my brother to replace him  !
here in the sands thee i 'll rake up  , the post unsanctified of murderous lechers  .
oswald i 'll bury you here in a shallow grave  , you messenger for lustful criminals  .
and in the mature time with this ungracious paper strike the sight of the death - practiced duke  .
in due time i 'll show this ugly letter to the duke whose life 's at risk  .
for him 't is well that of thy death and business i can tell  .
it 's a good thing for him that i can tell him about your death and the letter you were carrying  .

o thou good kent  , how shall i live and work to match thy goodness  ?
oh  , kent  , what could i ever do to become as good as you are  ?
my life will be too short  , and every measure fail me  .
i wo n't live long enough  , and all my efforts will fail me  .
to be acknowledged  , madam  , is o'erpaid  .
just being thanked is more than enough for me  , madam  .
all my reports go with the modest truth  , nor more  , nor clipped  , but so  .
i hope all reports about me simply tell the truth  , no more or less  .
be better suited  .
change into better clothes  .
these weeds are memories of those worser hours  .
these rags will just remind us of those bad times when you had to wear a disguise  .
i prithee  , put them off  .
please take them off  .
pardon  , dear madam  .
i 'm sorry  , madam  , but i ca n't do that yet  .

my boon i make it that you know me not till time and i think meet  .
i have to ask you  , as a favor  , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right  .

i am a very foolish fond old man  , fourscore and upward  , not an hour more nor less  .
i 'm a foolish  , senile old man  , eighty - something years old  , not an hour more or less  .
and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind  .
to put it plainly  , i 'm afraid i 'm not quite sane  .
methinks i should know you  , and know this man  .
i feel i should recognize you and that man kent  ,
and so i am  , i am  .
and i am  , i am  .
no cause  , no cause  .
i had no reason  , no reason  .

do not abuse me  .
do n't deceive me  .
be comforted  , good madam  .
you can relax  , ma'am  .
the great rage  , you see  , is killed in him  .
his insane period is over  .
and yet it is danger to make him even o'er the time he has lost  .
but it 's dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost  .

ask him to go in  .
trouble him no more till further settling  .
do n't trouble him further until his mind is more settled  .

most certain  , sir  .
yes  , it 's true  , sir  .
who is conductor of his people  ?

report is changeable  .
you ca n't trust all the rumors  .
tis time to look about  .

the powers of the kingdom approach apace  .
the british troops are coming near  .
the arbitrament is like to be bloody  .
it will likely be a bloody fight  .
fare you well  , sir  .
goodbye  , sir  .
my point and period will be throughly wrought  , or well or ill  , as this day 's battle 's fought  .
my life and my plans completely depend on how today 's battle ends  .
know of the duke if his last purpose hold  , or whether since he is advised by aught to change the course  .
go find out from the duke of albany if his decision still holds  , or if he 's changed his mind  .
he 's full of alteration and self - reproving  .
he 's always going back and forth and second - guessing himself  .
bring his constant pleasure  .
come back and tell me what his final decision is  .
our sister 's man is certainly miscarried  .
my sister 's servant oswald has certainly run into trouble  .
't is to be doubted  , madam  .
i 'm afraid that may be the case  , madam  .
now  , sweet lord  , you know the goodness i intend upon you  .
now  , my sweet lord  , you know how much i like you  .
tell me but truly but then speak the truth do you not love my sister  ?
tell me truthfully  , do you love my sister  ?
in honored love  .
yes  , truly and honorably  .
but have you never found my brother 's way to the forfended place  ?
but have you ever gone in my brother - in - law 's bed and had sex with her  ?
i am doubtful that you have been conjunct and bosomed with her as far as we call hers  .
i 'm just worried that you 've been cozying up to her  , and gotten intimate with her  .
no  , by mine honor  , madam  .
no  , i swear on my honor  , i have n't  , madam  .
i never shall endure her  .
i ca n't stand her  .
dear my lord  , be not familiar with her  .
please  , my lord  , do n't be friendly with her  .
fear me not  .
do n't worry about me  .
she and the duke her husband  !
your sister and the duke are here  .
i had rather lose the battle than that sister should loosen him and me  .
i 'd rather lose this battle than allow that sister of mine to come between me and edmund  .
our very loving sister  , well bemet  .
my dear and loving sister - in - law  , i 'm happy to see you  .
sir  , this i hear  : the king is come to his daughter  , with others whom the rigor of our state forced to cry out  .
edmund sir  , i 've heard that the king has joined up with his daughter as well as others who have complained about our strict policies  .
where i could not be honest i never yet was valiant  .
i 've never fought for a cause i did n't believe in  .
for this business  , it touches us as france invades our land  , not bolds the king  , with others whom i fear most just and heavy causes make oppose  .
i 'm concerned about the french because they have invaded our soil  , not because they support king lear or those others who  , i 'm afraid  , may have legitimate grievances against us  .
sir  , you speak nobly  .
noble words  , sir  .
why is this reasoned  ?
why are we talking about this  ?
let 's then determine with the ancient of war on our proceedings  .
then let 's meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next  .
i shall attend you presently at your tent  .
i 'll meet you at your tent  .
sister  , you 'll go with us  ?
goneril  , are you coming with us  ?
no  .
no  .
't is most convenient  .
it 's the best thing to do  .
pray you  , go with us  .
please come with me  .
oh ho  , i know the riddle  .
oh ho  , i know her little tricks  .
i will go  .
okay  , i 'll go  .
albany if e'er your grace had speech with man so poor  , hear me one word  .
albany if you can stoop to speak to a man as poor as i am  , then listen to me  , please  .
edmund regan goneril i 'll overtake you  .
edmund regan goneril i 'll catch up with you  .
speak  .
go ahead  .
albany before you fight the battle  , ope this letter  .
albany before you go into battle  , open this letter  .
if you have victory  , let the trumpet sound for him that brought it  .
if you win  , then blow your trumpet as a signal for me  .
wretched though i seem  , i can produce a champion that will prove what is avouchd there  .
i may look wretched  , but i 'll bravely stand up to defend my claims  .
if you miscarry  , your business of the world hath so an end  , and machination ceases  .
if you die in battle  , all your projects and this plan are off  .
fortune love you  .
good luck to you  .
stay till i have read the letter  .
wait until i read the letter  .
i was forbid it  .
i was ordered not to  .
when time shall serve  , let but the herald cry  , and i 'll appear again  .
when the time comes  , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and i 'll return  .
why  , fare thee well  .
goodbye  , then  .
i will o'erlook thy paper  .
i 'll take a look at your letter  .
we will greet the time  .
we 'll be ready when the time comes  .
here  , father  , take the shadow of this tree for your good host  .
here  , father  , rest awhile in the shade of this tree  .
pray that the right may thrive  .
say a little prayer for our side in battle  .
if ever i return to you again  , i 'll bring you comfort  .
if i ever come back  , i 'll bring you good news  .
grace go with you  , sir  .
good luck  , sir  .
no further  , sir  .
i ca n't go any further  , sir  .
a man may rot even here  .
this is as good a place as any to die  .
what  , in ill thoughts again  ?
are you depressed again  ?
men must endure their going hence even as their coming hither  .
you ca n't choose your time of death any more than your time of birth  .
ripeness is all  .
we live and die when our time comes  .
come on  .
come on  .
and that 's true too  .
and that 's true too  .
some officers take them away  .
officers  , take them away  .
good guard until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them  .
guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them  .
take them away  .
take them away  .
upon such sacrifices  , my cordelia  , the gods themselves throw incense  .
my cordelia  , even the gods admire how much you 've sacrificed for me  .
have i caught thee  ?
have i hugged you yet  ?
he that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven and fire us hence like foxes  .
anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes  .
wipe thine eyes  .
wipe your eyes  .
the good years shall devour them  , flesh and fell  , ere they shall make us weep  .
our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again  .
we 'll see 'em starve first  .
we 'll watch them starve to death first  .
come  .
come on  .
come hither  , captain  .
come here  , captain  .
hark  .
listen  .
first captain take thou this note  .
first captain take this note  .
go follow them to prison  .
follow those two to prison and follow these instructions  .
one step i have advanced thee  .
i 've already promoted you once  .
if thou dost as this instructs thee  , thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes  .
if you do as you 're told  , you 'll be richly rewarded  .
know thou this  : that men are as the time is  .
just remember this  : you have to go with the times  , and these are the times for being tough  .
to be tender - minded does not become a sword  .
a soldier ca n't afford to be a ninny  .
thy great employment will not bear question  .
there 'll be no quibbling about this assignment  .
either say thou'lt do 't  , or thrive by other means  .
either you accept it  , or go find some other way to support yourself  .
i 'll do 't  , my lord  .
i 'll do it  , sir  .
i do require them of you  , so to use them as we shall find their merits and our safety may equally determine  .
tody of them so i can do what 's best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom  .
i hold you but a subject of this war  , not as a brother  .
i 'm sorry  , sir  , but in this war i consider you a subordinate  , not my equal  .
that 's as we list to grace him  .
that 's for to me to decide  .
methinks our pleasure might have been demanded ere you had spoke so far  .
you might have asked my opinion before saying something so rude  .
he led our powers  , bore the commission of my place and person the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother  .
edmund has led our forces well  , and implemented my wishes and his close connection with me gives him the right to be considered your equal  .
not so hot  .
not so fast  .
in his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition  .
he has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right  , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him  .
in my rights  , by me invested  , he compeers the best  .
i 'm the one who gave him his military commission  , and it is as my proxy that he fought bravely  .
that were the most if he should husband you  .
he 'd really be your proxy if he married you  .
jesters do oft prove prophets  .
do n't joke  , it might come true  .
holla  , holla  !
whoa  , whoa  !
that eye that told you so looked but asquint  .
you 're so infatuated with him that you 're hallucinating  .
mean you to enjoy him then  ?
are you trying to sleep with him  ?
the let - alone lies not in your good will  .
goneril it 's not up to you to say yes or no  .
nor in thine  , lord  .
nor is it up to you  , my lord  .
half - blooded fellow  , yes  .
yes it is  , you half - blood  .
stay yet  .
hang on a second  .
hear reason  .
listen to me  .
edmund  , i arrest thee on capital treason  , and in thine attaint this gilded serpent  .
edmund  , you 're under arrest for capital treason  .
goneril regan for your claim  , fair sister  , i bar it in the interest of my wife  .
along with you  , your co - conspirator  , this snake of a woman  .
't is she is subcontracted to this lord  .
goneril regan my dear sister - in - law  , i veto your marriage announcement for the benefit of my wife  , who is already engaged to edmund  .
and i  , her husband  , contradict your banns  .
so if you want to get married  , you 'll have to woo me  .
if you will marry  , make your loves to me  , my lady is bespoke  .
my wife 's already spoken for  .
an interlude  !
what a farce  !
thou art armed  , gloucester  .
you 've got a sword  , gloucester  .
let the trumpet sound  .
blow the trumpets  .
if none appear to prove upon thy person thy heinous  , manifest  , and many treasons  , there is my pledge  .
if nobody else comes to challenge you and prove what an abominable traitor you have been  , i 'll have to challenge you myself  .
i 'll make it on thy heart  , ere i taste bread  , thou art in nothing less than i have here proclaimed thee  .
i 'll prove soon enough that you 're just as wicked as i say you are  .
sick  , oh  , sick  !
oh  , i 'm sick  , sick  !
if not  , i 'll ne'er trust medicine  .
if she 's not ill  , i 'll never trust drugs again  .
there 's my exchange  .
you 're on  .
what in the world he is that names me traitor  , villainlike he lies  .
whoever calls me a traitor is a vicious liar  .
call by thy trumpet  .
blow the trumpet  .
he that dares approach  , on him on you  , who not  ?
anyone who dares to step forward and make that accusation you or anyone else go ahead  .
i will maintain my truth and honor firmly  .
i 'll uphold my truth and my honor  .
a herald  , ho  !
a call a herald  !
a herald  , ho  , a herald  !

himself  .
i 'm my own spokesman  .
what sayst thou to him  ?
what do you have to say to me  ?
which  , for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise  , this sword of mine shall give them instant way  , where they shall rest for ever  .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart  .
trumpets  , speak  !
trumpets  , blow  !
save him  , save him  !
edgar save him  , save him  !
this is practice  , gloucester  .
you were tricked into fighting  , gloucester  .
by th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite  .
according to the laws of war  , you did n't have to fight a stranger  .
thou art not vanquished  , but cozened and beguiled  .
you have n't lost this fight  ; you 've been tricked and deceived  .
say  , if i do  ?
and what if i do  ?
the laws are mine  , not thine  .
i make the laws  , not you  .
who can arraign me for 't  ?
who can prosecute me for it  ?
most monstrous  , oh  !
oh  , monstrous  !
edmund know'st thou this paper  ?
edmund do you know what letter this is  ?
ask me not what i know  .

make sure she does n't do anything stupid  .
what you have charged me with  , that have i done and more  , much more  .
i 've done everything you accuse me of and more  , much more  .
the time will bring it out  .
you 'll find out everything in due time  .
't is past  , and so am i .
it 's all over now  , and so am i .
edgar but what art thou that hast this fortune on me  ?
edgar but who are you  , you who 've managed to defeat me  ?
if thou'rt noble  , i do forgive thee  .
if you 're a nobleman  , i forgive you  .
let 's exchange charity  .
let 's forgive each other  .
i am no less in blood than thou art  , edmund  .
i 'm no less noble than you are  , edmund  .
if more  , the more thou'st wronged me  .
if i 'm more noble than you  , you 've done me wrong  .
my name is edgar  , and thy father 's son  .
my name is edgar  , and i 'm your father 's son  .
the gods are just  , and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us  .
the gods are fair  , and they use our little vices to punish us  .
the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes  .
the woman he committed adultery with  , your mother  , cost him his eyes  .
methought thy very gait did prophesy a royal nobleness  .
i suspected that you were noble when i saw how you walked  .
i must embrace thee  .
let me embrace you  .
let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father  .
i swear i never hated you or your father  !
worthy prince  , i know 't  .
i know  , prince  .
where have you hid yourself  ?
where have you been hiding  ?
how have you known the miseries of your father  ?
how did you know what happened to your poor father  ?
by nursing them  , my lord  .
i knew because i helped nurse him through his suffering  .
list a brief tale  , and when 't is told  , oh  , that my heart would burst  !
listen to my little story  , and when it 's done  , oh  , my heart will break  !
the bloody proclamation to escape  , that followed me so near o our lives ' sweetness  ,
to escape the decree condemning me
this speech of yours hath moved me  , and shall perchance do good  .
your words have moved me  , and maybe it 'll do some good  .
but speak you on  .
but go on  .
you look as you had something more to say  .
you look like you have something more to say  .
if there be more  , more woeful  , hold it in  .
if there 's anything more sorrowful left to add  , keep it to yourself  .
for i am almost ready to dissolve  , hearing of this  .
i 'm almost ready to break down hearing this much  .
his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack  .
more  , until his heart started to break  .
twice then the trumpets sounded  , and there i left him tranced  .
then i heard the trumpets blow twice  , and left him there in a trance  .
but who was this  ?
but who was that man  ?
kent  , sir  , the banished kent  , who in disguise followed his enemy king and did him service improper for a slave  .
it was kent  , sir  , the exiled kent  , who  , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state  , put on a disguise and followed his king  , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave  .

all three of us will marry now in death  .
here comes kent  .
here comes kent  .
produce their bodies  , be they alive or dead  .
second knight bring the bodies here  , whether they 're alive or dead  .
this judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble touches us not with pity  .
we tremble at the gods ' wrath  , but we do n't mourn these deaths  .
oh  , is this he  ?
oh  , is that kent  ?
the time will not allow the compliment which very manners urges  .
there 's no time for polite greetings  .
i am come to bid my king and master aye good night  .
i 've come to say farewell to my king and master  .
is he not here  ?

as whence the sun 'gins his reflection shipwracking storms and direful thunders break  , so from that spring whence comfort seemed to come discomfort swells  .
but in the same way that violent storms always come just as spring appears  , our success against macdonwald created new problems for us  .
mark  , king of scotland  , mark  : no sooner justice had  , with valor armed  , compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels  , but the norweyan lord  , surveying vantage  , with furbished arms and new supplies of men  , began a fresh assault  .
listen to this  , king  : as soon as we sent those irish soldiers running for cover  , the norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons  .
dismayed not this our captains  , macbeth and banquo  ?
did n't this frighten our captains  , macbeth and banquo  ?

the thane of cawdor is still alive  .
why do you dress me in borrowed robes  ?
why are you giving me his title  ?
 ) two truths are told  , as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial theme  .
so far the witches have told me two things that came true  , so it seems like this will culminate in my becoming king  .
ross angus i thank you  , gentlemen  .
ross angus thank you  , gentlemen  .
this supernatural soliciting can not be ill  , can not be good  .
this supernatural temptation does n't seem like it can be a bad thing  , but it ca n't be good either  .
if ill  , why hath it given me earnest of success  , commencing in a truth  ?
if it 's a bad thing  , why was i promised a promotion that turned out to be true  ?
i am thane of cawdor  .
now i 'm the thane of cawdor  , just like they said i would be  .
if good  , why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs  , against the use of nature  ?
but if this is a good thing  , why do i find myself thinking about murdering king duncan  , a thought so horrifying that it makes my hair stand on end and my heart pound inside my chest  ?
present fears are less than horrible imaginings  .
the dangers that actually threaten me here and now frighten me less than the horrible things i 'm imagining  .
look how our partner 's rapt  .
look at macbeth he 's in a daze  .
if chance will have me king  , why  , chance may crown me without my stir  .
if fate wants me to be king  , perhaps fate will just make it happen and i wo n't have to do anything  .
come what come may  , time and the hour runs through the roughest day  .
one way or another  , what 's going to happen is going to happen  .
worthy macbeth  , we stay upon your leisure  .
good macbeth  , we 're ready when you are  .
very gladly  .
absolutely  .
till then  , enough  .
until then  , we 've said enough  .
ross angus come  , friends  .
ross angus let 's go  , my friends  .
is execution done on cawdor  ?
has the former thane of cawdor been executed yet  ?
are not those in commission yet returned  ?
have n't the people in charge of that come back  ?
my liege  , they are not yet come back  .
my king  , they have n't come back yet  .
but i have spoke with one that saw him die  , who did report that very frankly he confessed his treasons  , implored your highness ' pardon  , and set forth a deep repentance  .
but i spoke with someone who saw cawdor die  , and he said that cawdor openly confessed his treasons  , begged your highness 's forgiveness  , and repented deeply  .
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it  .
he never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died  .
he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as 'twere a careless trifle  .
he died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage  .
there 's no art to find the mind 's construction in the face  .
there 's no way to read a man 's mind by looking at his face  .
he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust  .
i trusted cawdor completely  .
there  , if i grow  , the harvest is your own  .
then if i accomplish anything great  , it will be a credit to you  .
my worthy cawdor  !
my worthy cawdor  !
the prince of cumberland  !
malcolm is now the prince of cumberland  !
that is a step on which i must fall down  , or else o'erleap  , for in my way it lies  .
to become king myself  , i 'm either going to have to step over him or give up  , because he 's in my way  .
stars  , hide your fires  ; let not light see my black and deep desires  .
stars  , hide your light so no one can see the terrible desires within me  .
the eye wink at the hand  , yet let that be which the eye fears  , when it is done  , to see  .
i wo n't let my eye look at what my hand is doing  , but in the end i 'm still going to do that thing i 'd be horrified to see  .
they met me in the day of success  , and i have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge  .
the witches met me on the day of my victory in battle  , and i have since learned that they have supernatural knowledge  .
when i burned in desire to question them further  , they made themselves air  , into which they vanished  .
when i tried desperately to question them further  , they vanished into thin air  .
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king  , who all - hailed me 'thane of cawdor  , ' by which title  , before  , these weird sisters saluted me  , and referred me to the coming on of time with 'hail  , king that shalt be  ! '
while i stood spellbound  , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of cawdor  , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me 'the future king  ! '
this have i thought good to deliver thee  , my dearest partner of greatness  , that thou might'st not lose the dues of rejoicing  , by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee  .
i thought i should tell you this news  , my dearest partner in greatness  , so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us  .
lay it to thy heart  , and farewell  .
keep it secret  , and farewell  .
what is your tidings  ?

the king comes here tonight  .
the king is coming here tonight  .
thou 'rt mad to say it  .
you must be crazy to say that  !
is not thy master with him  , who  , were 't so  , would have informed for preparation  ?
is n't macbeth with the king  , and would n't macbeth have told me in advance so i could prepare  , if the king were really coming  ?
give him tending  .
take good care of him  .
he brings great news  .
he brings great news  .
the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan under my battlements  .
so the messenger is short of breath  , like a hoarse raven  , as he announces duncan 's entrance into my fortress  , where he will die  .
come  , you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts  , unsex me here  , and fill me from the crown to the toe top - full of direst cruelty  .
come  , you spirits that asist murderous thoughts  , make me less like a woman and more like a man  , and fill me from head to toe with deadly cruelty  !
make thick my blood  .
thicken my blood and clog up my veins so i wo n't feel remorse  , so that no human compassion can stop my evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it  !
stop up the access and passage to remorse  , that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose  , nor keep peace between the effect and it  !
come to my female breast and turn my mother 's milk into poisonous acid  , you murdering demons  , wherever you hide  , invisible and waiting to do evil  !
come to my woman 's breasts  , and take my milk for gall  , you murd'ring ministers  , wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature 's mischief  .
come  , thick night  , and cover the world in the darkest smoke of hell  , so that my sharp knife ca n't see the wound it cuts open  , and so heaven ca n't peep through the darkness and cry  , no  !
come  , thick night  , and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell  , that my keen knife see not the wound it makes  , nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry hold  , hold  !
stop  !

this castle hath a pleasant seat  .
this castle is in a pleasant place  .
the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses  .
the air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses  .
this guest of summer  , the temple - haunting martlet  , does approve  , by his loved mansionry  , that the heaven 's breath smells wooingly here  .
the fact that this summer bird  , the house martin  , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are  .
no jutty  , frieze  , buttress  , nor coign of vantage  , but this bird hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle  .
there is n't a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds have n't built their hanging nests to sleep and breed  .
where they most breed and haunt  , i have observed  , the air is delicate  .
i 've noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest  .
see  , see  , our honored hostess  !
look  , here comes our honored hostess  !
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble  , which still we thank as love  .
sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient  , but i still accept it as love  .
herein i teach you how you shall bid god 'ild us for your pains  , and thank us for your trouble  .
in doing so  , i 'm teaching you to thank me for the incovenience i 'm causing you by being here  , because it comes from my love to you  .
all our service  , in every point twice done and then done double  , were poor and single business to contend against those honors deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house  .
everything we 're doing for you  , even if it were doubled and then doubled again  , is nothing compared to the honors you have brought to our family  .
for those of old  , and the late dignities heaped up to them  , we rest your hermits  .
we gladly welcome you as our guests  , with gratitude for both the honors you 've given us before and the new honors you 've just given us  .
your servants ever have theirs  , themselves  , and what is theirs in compt  , to make their audit at your highness ' pleasure  , still to return your own  .
we are your servants  , your highness  , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal  , for after all  , we keep it in your trust and we 're glad to give you back what 's yours  .
give me your hand  .

by your leave  , hostess  .
whenever you 're ready  , hostess  .

hath he asked for me  ?
has he asked for me  ?
know you not he has  ?
do n't you know he has  ?
was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself  ?
were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before  ?
hath it slept since  ?
have you gone to sleep and woken up green and pale in fear of this idea  ?
and wakes it now  , to look so green and pale at what it did so freely  ?
from now on this is what i 'll think of your love  .
from this time such i account thy love  .
are you afraid to act the way you desire  ?
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire  ?
will you take the crown you want so badly  , or will you live as a coward  , always saying i ca n't after you say i want to  ?
wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life  , and live a coward in thine own esteem  , letting i dare not wait upon i would  , like the poor cat i ' th ' adage  ?
you 're like the poor cat in the old story  .
if we should fail  ?
but if we fail
bring forth men - children only  , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males  .
may you only give birth to male children  , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that is n't masculine  .
will it not be received  , when we have marked with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers  , that they have done 't  ?
once we have covered the two servants with blood  , and used their daggers to kill  , wo n't people believe that they were the culprits  ?
i am settled  , and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat  .
now i 'm decided  , and i will exert every muscle in my body to commit this crime  .
away  , and mock the time with fairest show  .
go now  , and pretend to be a friendly hostess  .
false face must hide what the false heart doth know  .
hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false  , evil heart  .

there 's husbandry in heaven  ; their candles are all out  .

take thee that too  .
take this  , too  .
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me  , and yet i would not sleep  .
i 'm tired and feeling heavy  , but i ca n't sleep  .
merciful powers  , restrain in me the cursd thoughts that nature gives way to in repose  .
merciful powers  , keep away the nightmares that plague me when i rest  !
give me my sword  .
give me my sword  .
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?
a friend  .
a friend  .
being unprepared  , our will became the servant to defect  , which else should free have wrought  .
because we were unprepared for the king 's visit  , we were n't able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to  .
i think not of them  .
i do n't think about them now  .
yet  , when we can entreat an hour to serve  , we would spend it in some words upon that business  , if you would grant the time  .
but when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it  , if you 're willing  .
at your kind'st leisure  .
whenever you like  .
if you shall cleave to my consent  , when 't is  , it shall make honor for you  .
if you stick with me  , when the time comes  , there will be something in it for you  .
so i lose none in seeking to augment it  , but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear  , i shall be counselled  .
i 'll do whatever you say  , as long as i can do it with a clear conscience  .
good repose the while  !
rest easy in the meantime  .

servant go and tell your mistress to strike the bell when my drink is ready  .
get thee to bed  .

that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold  .
the alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold  .
what hath quenched them hath given me fire  .
the same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up  .
hark  !
listen  !
peace  !
quiet  !
it was the owl that shrieked  , the fatal bellman  , which gives the stern'st good - night  .
that was the owl that shrieked  , with a scary good night like the bells they ring before they execute people  .
he is about it  .
macbeth must be killing the king right now  .
the doors are open  , and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores  .
the doors to duncan 's chamber are open  , and the drunk servants make a mockery of their jobs by snoring instead of protecting the king  .
i have drugged their possets  , that death and nature do contend about them  , whether they live or die  .
i put so many drugs in their drinks that you ca n't tell if they 're alive or dead  .
who 's there  ?
who 's there  ?

there are two lodged together  .
malcolm and donalbain are asleep in the same room  .
one cried  , god bless us  !
one servant cried  , god bless us  !
and amen the other  , as they had seen me with these hangman 's hands  .
and the other replied  , amen  , as if they had seen my bloody hands  .
list'ning their fear i could not say amen  , when they did say god bless us  !
listening to their frightened voices  , i could n't reply amen when they said god bless us  !
consider it not so deeply  .
do n't think about it so much  .
but wherefore could not i pronounce amen  ?
but why could n't i say amen  ?
i had most need of blessing  , and amen stuck in my throat  .
i desperately needed god 's blessing  , but the word amen stuck in my throat  .
these deeds must not be thought after these ways  .
we ca n't think that way about what we did  .
so  , it will make us mad  .
if we do  , it 'll drive us crazy  .
what do you mean  ?
what are you talking about  ?
who was it that thus cried  ?
who said that  ?
why  , worthy thane  , you do unbend your noble strength to think so brainsickly of things  .
why  , my worthy lord  , you let yourself become weak when you think about things in this cowardly way  .
go get some water  , and wash this filthy witness from your hand  .
go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands  .
why did you bring these daggers from the place  ?
why did you carry these daggers out of the room  ?
they must lie there  .
they have to stay there  .
go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood  .
go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood  .
whence is that knocking  ?
where is that knocking coming from  ?
how is 't with me when every noise appals me  ?

they pluck out mine eyes  .
they 're plucking out my eyes  .
will all great neptune 's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand  ?
will all the water in the ocean wash this blood from my hands  ?
no  , this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine  , making the green one red  .
no  , instead my hands will stain the seas scarlet  , turning the green waters red  .
my hands are of your color  , but i shame to wear a heart so white  .
my hands are as red as yours  , but i would be ashamed if my heart were as pale and weak  .
i hear a knocking at the south entry  .
i hear someone knocking at the south entry  .
retire we to our chamber  .
let 's go back to our bedroom  .
a little water clears us of this deed  .
a little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt  .
how easy is it  , then  !
it 's so simple  !
your constancy hath left you unattended  .
you 've lost your resolve  .
hark  !
listen  !
more knocking  .
there 's more knocking  .
get on your nightgown  , lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers  .
put on your nightgown  , in case someone comes and sees that we 're awake  .
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts  .
snap out of your daze  .
to know my deed  , 'twere best not know myself  .
rather than have to think about my crime  , i 'd prefer to be completely unconscious  .
wake duncan with thy knocking  .
wake duncan with your knocking  .
i would thou couldst  .
i wish you could  !
here 's a knocking indeed  !
this is a lot of knocking  !
if a man were porter of hell - gate  , he should have old turning the key  .
come to think of it  , if a man were in charge of opening the gates of hell to let people in  , he would have to turn the key a lot  .
knock  , knock  !
knock  , knock  !
never at quiet  .
never a moment of peace  !

who are you  ?
but this place is too cold for hell  .
ah  , this place is too cold to be hell  .
i 'll devil - porter it no further  .
i wo n't pretend to be the devil 's porter anymore  .
i had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire  .
i was going to let someone from every profession into hell  .
anon  , anon  !
i 'm coming  , i 'm coming  !
i pray you  , remember the porter  .
please  , do n't forget to leave me a tip  .
was it so late  , friend  , ere you went to bed  , that you do lie so late  ?
did you go to bed so late  , my friend  , that you 're having a hard time getting up now  ?
what three things does drink especially provoke  ?
what three things does drink make a man do  ?
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night  .
i believe drink did all of this to you last night  .
is thy master stirring  ?
is your master awake  ?
our knocking has awaked him  .
our knocking woke him up  .
here he comes  .
here he comes  .
good morrow  , noble sir  .
good morning  , noble sir  .
good morrow  , both  .
good morning to both of you  .
is the king stirring  , worthy thane  ?
is the king awake  , worthy thane  ?
not yet  .
not yet  .
he did command me to call timely on him  .
he commanded me to wake him up early  .
i have almost slipped the hour  .
i 've almost missed the time he requested  .
i 'll bring you to him  .
i 'll bring you to him  .
i know this is a joyful trouble to you  , but yet 't is one  .
i know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble  , but that does n't mean it 's not a trouble just the same  .
the labor we delight in physics pain  .
the work we enjoy is not really work  .
this is the door  .
this is the door  .
i 'll make so bold to call  , for 't is my limited service  .
i 'll wake him  , because that 's my job  .
goes the king hence today  ?
is the king leaving here today  ?
he does  .
he is  .
he did appoint so  .
he told us to arrange it  .
't was a rough night  .
it was a rough night  .
my young remembrance can not parallel a fellow to it  .
i 'm too young to remember anything like it  .
o horror  , horror  , horror  !
oh  , horror  , horror  , horror  !
tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee  !
this is beyond words and beyond belief  !
what 's the matter  ?

most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the lord 's anointed temple  , and stole thence the life o ' th ' building  !
a murderer has broken into and stolen the life out of it  .
what is 't you say  ?
what are you talking about  ?
the life  ?
the life  ?
mean you his majesty  ?
do you mean the king  ?
o banquo  , banquo  , our royal master 's murdered  !
oh banquo  , banquo  , the king has been murdered  !
woe  , alas  !
how horrible  !
what  , in our house  ?
what  , in our own house  ?
too cruel any where  .
it would be a terrible event no matter where it happened  .
dear duff  , i prithee  , contradict thyself  , and say it is not so  .
dear macduff  , i beg you  , tell us you were lying and say it is n't so  .
what is amiss  ?
what 's wrong  ?
you are  , and do not know 't  .
you are  , but you do n't know it yet  .
the spring  , the head  , the fountain of your blood is stopped  ; the very source of it is stopped  .
the source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped  .
your royal father 's murdered  .
your royal father is murdered  .
oh  , by whom  ?
who did it  ?
those of his chamber  , as it seemed  , had done 't  .
it seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it  .
their hands and faces were all badged with blood  .
their hands and faces were all covered with blood  .
so were their daggers  , which unwiped we found upon their pillows  .
so were their daggers  , which we found on their pillows  , unwiped  .
they stared  , and were distracted  .
they stared at us in confusion  .
no man 's life was to be trusted with them  .
no one 's life should have been entrusted to them  .
oh  , yet i do repent me of my fury  , that i did kill them  .
and yet i still regret the anger that drove me to kill them  .
wherefore did you so  ?
what did you do that for  ?
help me hence  , ho  !
help me out of here  , quickly  !
look to the lady  .
take care of the lady  .
malcolm what should be spoken here  , where our fate  , hid in an auger - hole  , may rush and seize us  ?
malcolm what are we going to say here  , where danger may be waiting to strike at us from anywhere  ?
let 's away  .
let 's get out of here  .
our tears are not yet brewed  .
we have n't even begun to weep yet but there will be time for that later  .
donalbain nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion  .
donalbain and the time has n't come yet for us to turn our deep grief into action  .
look to the lady  .
take care of the lady  .
and when we have our naked frailties hid  , that suffer in exposure  , let us meet and question this most bloody piece of work  , to know it further  .
when we 're properly dressed for the cold  , let 's meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we can figure anything out  .
fears and scruples shake us  .
right now we 're shaken up by fears and doubts  .
in the great hand of god i stand  , and thence against the undivulged pretense i fight of treasonous malice  .
i 'm putting myself in god 's hands  , and with his help i plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder  .
and so do i  .

so will we all  .
let 's briefly put on manly readiness  , and meet i ' th ' hall together  .
let 's get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall  .
well contented  .
agreed  .
what will you do  ?
what are you going to do  ?
let 's not consort with them  .
let 's not stay here with them  .
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy  .
it 's easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none  .

i 'll go to ireland  .
our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer  .
we 'll both be safer if we go separate ways  .
where we are  , there 's daggers in men 's smiles  .
wherever we go  , men will smile at us while hiding daggers  .
the near in blood  , the nearer bloody  .
our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us  .
't is unnatural  , even like the deed that 's done  .
it 's unnatural  , just like the murder that has been committed  .
on tuesday last  , a falcon  , tow'ring in her pride of place  , was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed  .
last tuesday a falcon was circling high in the sky  , and it was caught and killed by an ordinary owl that usually goes after mice  .
't is said they eat each other  .
they say the horses ate each other  .
how goes the world  , sir  , now  ?
how are things going now  ?
why  , see you not  ?
ca n't you see for yourself  ?
is 't known who did this more than bloody deed  ?
does anyone know who committed this horrible crime  ?
those that macbeth hath slain  .
the servants macbeth killed  .
alas  , the day  !
it 's too bad he killed them  .
what good could they pretend  ?
what good would it have done those men to kill duncan  ?
they were suborned  .
they were paid to betray their master  .
malcolm and donalbain  , the king 's two sons  , are stol'n away and fled  , which puts upon them suspicion of the deed  .
malcolm and donalbain  , the king 's two sons  , have run away and fled  , which makes them the prime suspects  .
'gainst nature still  !
everything about this is unnatural  !
thriftless ambition  , that will raven up thine own lives ' means  !
what a stupid ambition  , causing a son to kill the father who supports him  .
then 't is most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth  .
then it looks like macbeth will become king  .
he is already named and gone to scone to be invested  .
he has already been named king and has left for scone to be crowned  .
where is duncan 's body  ?
where is duncan 's body  ?

here 's our chief guest  .
here 's our most important guest  .
if he had been forgotten  , it had been as a gap in our great feast  , and all - thing unbecoming  .

do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go  ?

are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue  , whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever  ?
are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children  , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever  ?
we are men  , my liege  .
we are men  , my lord  .
i am one  , my liege  , whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world  .
my lord  , i 've been so kicked around by the world  , and i 'm so angry  , that i do n't even care what i do  .

go tell the king i want to talk to him for a few minutes  .

naught 's had  , all 's spent  , where our desire is got without content  .
if you get what you want and you 're still not happy  , you 've spent everything and gained nothing  .
't is safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy  .
it 's better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety  .
come on  , gentle my lord  , sleek o'er your rugged looks  .
come on  , relax  , dear  .
be bright and jovial among your guests tonight  .
put on a happy face and look cheerful and agreeable for your guests tonight  .

there 's only one body here  .
the son is fled  .
the son ran away  .
we have lost best half of our affair  .

here i 'll sit i ' th ' midst  .
i will sit here in the middle  .
be large in mirth  .
be free and happy  .
anon we 'll drink a measure the table round  .
soon we will toast around the table  .
first murderer there 's blood upon thy face  .
murderer there 's blood on your face  .
't is banquo 's then  .
then it must be banquo 's  .
't is better thee without than he within  .
i 'd rather see his blood splattered on your face than flowing through his veins  .
is he dispatched  ?
did you finish him off  ?
my lord  , his throat is cut  .
my lord  , his throat is cut  .
that i did for him  .
i did that to him  .
most royal sir  , fleance is 'scaped  .
most royal sir  , fleance has escaped  .
then comes my fit again  .
now i 'm scared again  .
i had else been perfect  , whole as the marble  , founded as the rock  , as broad and general as the casing air  .
otherwise i would have been perfect  , as solid as a piece of marble  , as firm as a rock  , as free as the air itself  .
but now i am cabined  , cribbed  , confined  , bound in to saucy doubts and fears  .
but now i 'm all tangled up with doubts and fears  .
but banquo 's safe  ?
but banquo 's been taken care of  ?
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my good lord  .
safe in a ditch he bides  , with twenty trenchd gashes on his head  , the least a death to nature  .
he 's lying dead in a ditch  , with twenty deep gashes in his head  , any one of which would have been enough to kill him  .

the worm that 's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed  ; no teeth for th ' present  .
the young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening  , but for now he has no fangs  .

since good digestion requires a good appetite  , and good health requires both of those  , here 's to good appetites  , good digestion  , and good health  !
may 't please your highness sit  .
why do n't you have a seat  , your highness  ?
his absence  , sir  , lays blame upon his promise  .
his absence means he 's broken his promise  , sir  .
please 't your highness to grace us with your royal company  ?
if it pleases you  , your highness  , why do n't you sit with us and grace us with your royal company  ?

you have displaced the mirth  , broke the good meeting  , with most admired disorder  .
you have ruined our good cheer and disrupted the gathering by making a spectacle of yourself  .
can such things be  , and overcome us like a summer 's cloud  , without our special wonder  ?
can things like this happen so suddenly without making us all astonished  ?
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe  , when now i think you can behold such sights  , and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks  , when mine is blanched with fear  .
you make me feel like i do n't know myself  , when i see you looking at these terrible things and keeping a straight face  , while my face has gone white with fear  .
what sights  , my lord  ?
what things  , my lord  ?
i pray you  , speak not  .
please  , do n't speak to him  .
he grows worse and worse  .

stand not upon the order of your going  , but go at once  .
do n't bother exiting in the order of your rank  , but just leave right away  .
a kind good night to all  !

two or three men  , my lord  , who brought the message that macduff has fled to england  .
fled to england  ?
fled to england  ?
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my good lord  .
what had he done to make him fly the land  ?
what did he do that made him flee this land  ?
you must have patience  , madam  .
you have to be patient  , madam  .
he had none  .
he had no patience  .
his flight was madness  .
he was crazy to run away  .
when our actions do not  , our fears do make us traitors  .
even if you 're not a traitor  , you 're going to look like one if you run away  .
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear  .
you do n't know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee  .
fathered he is  , and yet he 's fatherless  .
he has a father  , and yet he is fatherless  .
sirrah  , your father 's dead  .
young man  , your father 's dead  .
and what will you do now  ?
what are you going to do now  ?
how will you live  ?
how are you going to live  ?
as birds do  , mother  .
i will live the way birds do  , mother  .
with what i get  , i mean  , and so do they  .
i mean i will live on whatever i get  , like birds do  .
poor bird  !
you 'd be a pitiful bird  .
thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime  , the pitfall nor the gin  .
you would n't know enough to be afraid of traps  .
why should i  , mother  ?
why should i be afraid of them  , mother  ?
poor birds they are not set for  .
if i 'm a pitiful bird  , like you say  , hunters wo n't want me  .
my father is not dead  , for all your saying  .
no matter what you say  , my father is not dead  .
yes  , he is dead  .
yes  , he is dead  .
how wilt thou do for a father  ?
what are you going to do for a father  ?
nay  , how will you do for a husband  ?
maybe you should ask  , what will you do for a husband  ?
why  , i can buy me twenty at any market  .
oh  , i can buy twenty husbands at any market  .
then you 'll buy 'em to sell again  .
if so  , you 'd be buying them to sell again  .
thou speak'st with all thy wit  ; and yet  , i ' faith  , with wit enough for thee  .
you talk like a child  , but you 're very smart anyway  .
was my father a traitor  , mother  ?
was my father a traitor  , mother  ?
ay  , that he was  .
yes  , he was  .
what is a traitor  ?
what is a traitor  ?
why  , one that swears and lies  .
someone who makes a promise and breaks it  .
and be all traitors that do so  ?
and is everyone who swears and lies a traitor  ?
every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged  .
everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged  .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie  ?
and should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged  ?
every one  .
everyone  .
who must hang them  ?
who should hang them  ?
why  , the honest men  .
the honest men  .
then the liars and swearers are fools  , for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them  .
then the liars are fools  , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them  .
now  , god help thee  , poor monkey  !
heaven help you for saying that  , boy  !
but how wilt thou do for a father  ?
but what will you do without a father  ?
if he were dead  , you 'd weep for him  .
if he were dead  , you 'd be weeping for him  .
if you would not  , it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father  .
if you are n't weeping  , it 's a good sign that i 'll soon have a new father  .
poor prattler  , how thou talk'st  !
silly babbler  , how you talk  !
bless you  , fair dame  !
bless you  , fair lady  !
i am not to you known  , though in your state of honor i am perfect  .
you do n't know me  , but i know you 're an important person  .
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly  .
i 'm afraid something dangerous is coming toward you  .
if you will take a homely man 's advice  , be not found here  .
if you 'll take a simple man 's advice  , do n't be here when it arrives  .
hence with your little ones  .
go away and take your children  .
to fright you thus methinks i am too savage  ; to do worse to you were fell cruelty  , which is too nigh your person  .
i feel bad for scaring you like this  , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm  .
heaven preserve you  !
and harm is getting close  !
i dare abide no longer  .
heaven keep you safe  !
whither should i fly  ?
where should i go  ?
i have done no harm  .
i have n't done anything wrong  .
but i remember now i am in this earthly world  , where to do harm is often laudable  , to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly  .
but i have to remember that i 'm here on earth  , where doing evil is often praised  , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake  .
why then  , alas  , do i put up that womanly defense  , to say i have done no harm  ?
so then why should i offer this womanish defense that i 'm innocent  ?
what are these faces  ?
who are these men  ?
where is your husband  ?
where is your husband  ?
i hope  , in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him  .
i hope he 's not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him  .
he 's a traitor  .
he 's a traitor  .
thou liest  , thou shag - haired villain  !
you 're lying  , you shaggy - haired villain  !
what  , you egg  ?
what 's that  , you runt  ?
young fry of treachery  !
young son of a traitor  !
he has killed me  , mother  .
he has killed me  , mother  .
run away  , i pray you  !
run away  , i beg you  !
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty  .
let 's seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out  .
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and  , like good men  , bestride our downfall'n birthdom  .
instead of crying  , let 's keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men  .
each new morn new widows howl  , new orphans cry  , new sorrows strike heaven on the face  , that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yelled out like syllable of dolor  .
each day new widows howl  , new orphans cry  , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face  , until it sounds like heaven itself feels scotland 's anguish and screams in pain  .
i am not treacherous  .
i am not treacherous  .
but macbeth is  .
but macbeth is  .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge  .
even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command  .
but i shall crave your pardon  .
but i beg your pardon  .
that which you are  , my thoughts can not transpose  .
my fears ca n't actually make you evil  .
angels are bright still  , though the brightest fell  .
angels are still bright even though lucifer  , the brightest angel  , fell from heaven  .
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace  , yet grace must still look so  .
even though everything evil wants to look good  , good still has to look good too  .
i have lost my hopes  .
i have lost my hope of convincing you to fight against macbeth  .
bleed  , bleed  , poor country  !
bleed  , bleed  , poor country  !
great tyranny  , lay thou thy basis sure  , for goodness dare not check thee  .
great tyrant  , go ahead and build yourself up  , because good people are afraid to stand up to you  .
wear thou thy wrongs  ; the title is affeered  .
enjoy everything you stole  , because your title is safe  !
fare thee well  , lord  .
farewell  , lord  .
i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp  , and the rich east to boot  .
i would n't be the villain you think i am even if i were offered all of macbeth 's kingdom and the riches of the east too  .
what should he be  ?
who are you talking about  ?
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top macbeth  .
even in hell you could n't find a devil worse than macbeth  .
o scotland  , scotland  !
oh scotland  , scotland  !
if such a one be fit to govern  , speak  .
if someone like me is fit to be king  , let me know  .
i am as i have spoken  .
i really am exactly as i have described myself to you  .
whither indeed  , before thy here - approach  , old siward  , with ten thousand warlike men  , already at a point  , was setting forth  .
indeed  , before you arrived here  , old siward  , with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle  , was making his way here  .
now we 'll together  , and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel  !
now we will fight macbeth together  , and may the chances of our success be as great as the justice of our cause  !
why are you silent  ?
why are you silent  ?
such welcome and unwelcome things at once 't is hard to reconcile  .
it 's hard to make sense of such different stories  .
well  , more anon  .
well  , we 'll speak more soon  .

what 's the disease he means  ?
what disease is he talking about  ?
't is called the evil  .
it 's called the evil  .
a most miraculous work in this good king  , which often since my here - remain in england i have seen him do  .
edward 's healing touch is a miracle that i have seen him perform many times during my stay in england  .
how he solicits heaven  , himself best knows  , but strangely visited people  , all swoll'n and ulcerous  , pitiful to the eye  , the mere despair of surgery  , he cures  , hanging a golden stamp about their necks  , put on with holy prayers  .
how he receives these gifts from heaven  , only he can say  .
and  , 't is spoken  ,
but he cures people with strange conditions all swollen  , plagued by ulcers  , and pitiful to look at  , patients who are beyond the help of surgery by placing a gold coin around their necks and saying holy prayers over them  .
see  , who comes here  ?
who 's that coming over here  ?
my countryman  , but yet i know him not  .
by his dress i can tell he 's my countryman  , but i do n't recognize him  .
my ever - gentle cousin  , welcome hither  .
my noble kinsman  , welcome  .
i know him now  .
i recognize him now  .
good god  , betimes remove the means that makes us strangers  !
may god alter the circumstances that keep us apart  !
sir  , amen  .

oh  , relation too nice and yet too true  !
oh  , your report is too poetic  , but it sounds so true  !
what 's the newest grief  ?
what is the most recent news  ?
that of an hour 's age doth hiss the speaker  .
even news an hour old is old news  .
each minute teems a new one  .
every minute another awful thing happens  .
how does my wife  ?
how is my wife  ?
why  , well  .
she 's well  .
and all my children  ?
and all my children  ?
well too  .
they 're well too  .
the tyrant has not battered at their peace  ?
macbeth has n't attacked them  ?
no  , they were well at peace when i did leave 'em  .
they were when i left them  .
be not a niggard of your speech  .
do n't be stingy with your words  .
how goes 't  ?
what 's the news  ?
would i could answer this comfort with the like  .
i wish i could repay this happy news with good news of my own  .
but i have words that would be howled out in the desert air  , where hearing should not latch them  .
but i have some news that should be howled in a barren desert where nobody can hear it  .
no mind that 's honest but in it shares some woe  , though the main part pertains to you alone  .
no decent man can keep from sharing in the sorrow  , but my news affects you alone  .
if it be mine  , keep it not from me  .
if it 's for me  , do n't keep it from me  .
quickly let me have it  .
let me have it now  .
let not your ears despise my tongue forever  , which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard  .
i hope you wo n't hate me forever after i say these things  , because i will soon fill your ears with the most dreadful news you have ever heard  .
my children too  ?
they killed my children too  ?
wife  , children  , servants  , all that could be found  .
they killed your wife  , your children  , your servants  , anyone they could find  .
and i must be from thence  !
and i had to be away  !
my wife killed too  ?
my wife was killed too  ?
i have said  .
i said she was  .
be comforted  .
take comfort  .
let 's make us med'cines of our great revenge  , to cure this deadly grief  .
let 's cure this awful grief by taking revenge on macbeth  .
he has no children  .
he does n't have children  .
all my pretty ones  ?
all my pretty little children  ?
did you say all  ?
did you say all  ?
o hell - kite  !
oh  , that bird from hell  !
all  ?
all of them  ?
what  , all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop  ?
what  , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop  ?
dispute it like a man  .
fight it like a man  .
be this the whetstone of your sword  .
let this anger sharpen your sword  .
let grief convert to anger  .
transform your grief into anger  .
blunt not the heart  , enrage it  .
do n't block the feelings in your heart  ; let them loose as rage  .
oh  , i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue  !
i could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how i will avenge them  !
but  , gentle heavens  , cut short all intermission  .
but gentle heavens  , do n't keep me waiting  .
front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself  .
bring me face to face with macbeth  , that devil of scotland  .
within my sword 's length set him  ; if he 'scape  , heaven forgive him too  .
put him within the reach of my sword  , and if he escapes  , may heaven forgive him as well  !
i have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report  .
i 've stayed up with you for two nights now  , and i have n't seen any evidence of what you were talking about  .
when was it she last walked  ?
when was the last time you saw her sleepwalking  ?
since his majesty went into the field  , i have seen her rise from her bed  , throw her nightgown upon her  , unlock her closet  , take forth paper  , fold it  , write upon 't  , read it  , afterwards seal it  , and again return to bed  ; yet all this while in a most fast sleep  .
since macbeth went to war  , i have seen her rise from her bed  , put on her nightgown  , unlock her closet  , take out some paper  , fold it  , write on it  , read it  , seal it up  , and then return to bed  , remaining asleep the entire time  .
a great perturbation in nature  , to receive at once the benefit of sleep  , and do the line  > effects of watching  .
it 's unnatural to be asleep and act as if you 're awake  .
in this slumbery agitation  , besides her walking and other actual performances  , what  , at any time  , have you heard her say  ?
when she is like this  , besides walking and performing various activities  , have you heard her say anything  ?
that  , sir  , which i will not report after her  .
she says something  , sir  , but i will not repeat it to you  .
neither to you nor any one  , having no witness to confirm my speech  .
i will not confess it to you nor to anyone else  , because there was no one else to witness her speech  .
how came she by that light  ?
how did she get that candle  ?
why  , it stood by her  .
it stands by her bedside  .
she has light by her continually  .
she always has to have a light next to her  .
't is her command  .
those are her orders  .
you see her eyes are open  .
you see  , her eyes are open  .
ay  , but their sense is shut  .
yes  , but they do n't see anything  .
what is it she does now  ?
what 's she doing now  ?
look  , how she rubs her hands  .
look how she rubs her hands  .
yet here 's a spot  .
there 's still a spot here  .
hark  !
listen  !
she speaks  .
she 's talking  .
i will set down what comes from her  , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly  .
i 'll write down what she says  , so i 'll remember it better  .
out  , damned spot  !
come out  , damned spot  !
out  , i say  !
out  , i command you  !
one  , two  .
one  , two  .
why  , then  , 't is time to do 't  .
ok  , it 's time to do it now  .
hell is murky  !
hell is murky  !
fie  , my lord  , fie  !
nonsense  , my lord  , nonsense  !
a soldier  , and afeard  ?
you are a soldier  , and yet you are afraid  ?
what need we fear who knows it  , when none can call our power to account  ?
why should we be scared  , when no one can lay the guilt upon us  ?
yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him  .
but who would have thought the old man would have had so much blood in him  ?
do you mark that  ?
did you hear that  ?
the thane of fife had a wife  .
the thane of fife had a wife  .
where is she now  ?
where is she now  ?
what  , will these hands ne'er be clean  ?
what  , will my hands never be clean  ?
no more o ' that  , my lord  , no more o ' that  .
no more of that  , my lord  , no more of that  .
you mar all with this starting  .
you 'll ruin everything by acting startled like this  .
go to  , go to  .
now look what you 've done  .
you have known what you should not  .
you 've heard something you should n't have  .
she has spoke what she should not  , i am sure of that  .
she said something she should n't have said  , i 'm sure of that  .
heaven knows what she has known  .
heaven knows what secrets she 's keeping  .
here 's the smell of the blood still  .
i still have the smell of blood on my hand  .
all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand  .
all the perfumes of arabia could n't make my little hand smell better  .
oh  , oh  , oh  !
oh  , oh  , oh  !
what a sigh is there  !
what a heavy sigh  !
the heart is sorely charged  .
her heart is carrying a heavy weight  .
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body  .
i would n't want a heart like hers even if you made me queen  .
well  , well  , well  .
well  , well  , well  .
pray god it be  , sir  .
i hope what she 's saying is well  , sir  !
this disease is beyond my practice  .
this disease is beyond my medical skills  .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds  .
but i have known people who sleepwalked and were n't guilty of anything  .
even so  ?
is this true  ?
will she go now to bed  ?
will she go to bed now  ?
directly  .
yes  , right away  .
good night  , good doctor  .
good night  , good doctor  .
who knows if donalbain be with his brother  ?
does anyone know if donalbain is with his brother  ?
for certain  , sir  , he is not  .
he is definitely not there  , sir  .
i have a file of all the gentry  .
i have a list of all the important men  .
there is siward 's son  , and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood  .
siward 's son is there  , as well as many boys too young to have beards who will become men by joining in this battle  .
what does the tyrant  ?
what is the tyrant macbeth doing  ?
who then shall blame his pestered senses to recoil and start  , when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there  ?
who can blame him for acting crazy  , when inside he condemns himself for everything he 's done  ?
or so much as it needs  , to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds  .
however much blood we need to give to water the royal flower and drown the weeds to make malcolm king and get rid of macbeth  .
make we our march towards birnam  .
let 's proceed on our march to birnam  .
bring me no more reports  .
do n't bring me any more reports  .
let them fly all  .
i do n't care if all the thanes desert me  .
till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i can not taint with fear  .
until birnam wood gets up and moves to dunsinane  , i wo n't be affected by fear  .
what 's the boy malcolm  ?
what 's the boy malcolm  ?
was he not born of woman  ?
was n't he born from a woman  ?
the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus  : fear not  , macbeth  .
the spirits that know the future have told me this  : do n't be afraid  , macbeth  .
no man that 's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee  .
no man born from a woman will ever defeat you  .
then fly  , false thanes  , and mingle with the english epicures  .
so get out of here  , disloyal thanes  , and join the weak and decadent english  !
the mind i sway by and the heart i bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear  .
my mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear  .
the devil damn thee black  , thou cream - faced loon  !
may the devil turn you black  , you white - faced fool  !
where got'st thou that goose look  ?
why do you look like a frightened goose  ?
there is ten thousand
there are ten thousand
geese  , villain  ?
geese  , you idiot  ?
soldiers  , sir  .
soldiers  , sir  .
go  , prick thy face and over - red thy fear  , thou lily - livered boy  .
go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face  , you cowardly boy  .
what soldiers  , patch  ?
what soldiers  , fool  ?
death of thy soul  !
curse you  !
those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear  .
that pale face of yours will frighten the others as well  .
what soldiers  , whey - face  ?
what soldiers  , milk - face  ?
the english force  , so please you  .
the english army  , sir  .
take thy face hence  .
get out of my sight  .
what 's your gracious pleasure  ?
what do you want  ?
what news more  ?
is there more news  ?
all is confirmed  , my lord  , which was reported  .
all the rumors have been confirmed  .
i 'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked  .
i 'll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones  .
give me my armor  .
give me my armor  .
't is not needed yet  .
you do n't need it yet  .
not so sick  , my lord  , as she is troubled with thick - coming fancies that keep her from her rest  .
she is not sick  , my lord  , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping  .
therein the patient must minister to himself  .
for that kind of relief  , the patient must heal herself  .
ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my good lord  .
your royal preparation makes us hear something  .
your preparation for war sounds like something  .
bring it after me  .
seyton bring the armor and follow me  .
i will not be afraid of death and bane  , till birnam forest come to dunsinane  .
i will not be afraid of death and destruction until birnam forest picks itself up and moves to dunsinane  .
cousins  , i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe  .
kinsmen  , i hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms  .
we doubt it nothing  .
we do n't doubt it  .
what wood is this before us  ?
what 's the name of this forest behind us  ?
the wood of birnam  .
birnam wood  .
let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear 't before him  .
tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him  .
thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us  .
that way we can conceal how many of us there are  , and macbeth 's spies will give him inaccurate reports  .
it shall be done  .
we 'll do it  .
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before 't  .
we have no news except that the overconfident macbeth is still in dunsinane and will allow us to lay siege to the castle  .
the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe  .
soon we 'll find out what 's really ours and what is n't  .
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate  , but certain issue strokes must arbitrate  .
it 's easy for us to get our hopes up just sitting around thinking about it  , but the only way this is really going to be settled is by violence  .
towards which  , advance the war  .
so let 's move our armies forward  .
hang out our banners on the outward walls  .
hang our flags on the outer walls  .
the cry is still they come  !
everyone keeps yelling  , here they come  !
our castle 's strength will laugh a siege to scorn  .
our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige  .
here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up  .
they can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease  .
were they not forced with those that should be ours  , we might have met them dareful  , beard to beard  , and beat them backward home  .
if it were n't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them  , we could have met them out in front of the castle  , man to man  , and beaten them back to england  .
what is that noise  ?
what 's that noise  ?
it is the cry of women  , my good lord  .
it 's women crying  , my good lord  .
i have almost forgot the taste of fears  .
i 've almost forgotten what fear feels like  .
the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night - shriek  , and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in 't  .
there was a time when i would have been terrified by a shriek in the night  , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when i heard a ghost story  .
i have supped full with horrors  .
but now i 've had my fill of real horrors  .
direness  , familiar to my slaughterous thoughts can not once start me  .
horrible things are so familiar that they ca n't startle me  .
wherefore was that cry  ?
what was that cry for  ?
the queen  , my lord  , is dead  .
the queen is dead  , my lord  .
gracious my lord  , i should report that which i say i saw  , but know not how to do 't  .
my gracious lord  , i should tell you what i saw  , but i do n't know how to say it  .
well  , say  , sir  .
just say it  .
as i did stand my watch upon the hill  , i looked toward birnam  , and anon methought the wood began to move  .
as i was standing watch on the hill  , i looked toward birnam  , and i thought i saw the forest begin to move  .
liar and slave  !
liar and slave  !
let me endure your wrath  , if 't be not so  .
punish me if it 's not true  .
within this three mile may you see it coming  ; i say  , a moving grove  .
three miles from here you can see it coming  , a moving forest  .
now near enough  .
we 're close enough now  .
your leafy screens throw down  , and show like those you are  .
throw down these branches and show them who you really are  .
you  , worthy uncle  , shall  , with my cousin  , your right - noble son  , lead our first battle  .
uncle siward  , you and your son will lead the first battle  .
worthy macduff and we shall take upon 's what else remains to do  , according to our order  .
brave macduff and i will do the rest  , according to our battle plan  .
fare you well  .
good luck  .
do we but find the tyrant 's power tonight  , let us be beaten if we can not fight  .
if we meet macbeth 's army tonight  , let us be beaten if we can not fight  .
what is thy name  ?
what 's your name  ?
thou 'lt be afraid to hear it  .
you 'll be afraid to hear it  .
no  , though thou call'st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell  .
no i wo n't  , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell  .
my name 's macbeth  .
my name 's macbeth  .
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear  .
the devil himself could n't say a name i hate more  .
no  , nor more fearful  .
no  , nor could the devil 's name be more frightening  .
thou liest  , abhorrd tyrant  .
you lie  , you disgusting tyrant  .
with my sword i 'll prove the lie thou speak'st  .
i 'll prove with my sword that i 'm not scared of you  .
we have met with foes that strike beside us  .
our enemies fight as if they 're trying not to hurt us  .
enter  , sir  , the castle  .
sir  , enter the castle  .
why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword  ?
why should i commit suicide like one of the ancient romans  ?
whiles i see lives  , the gashes do better upon them  .
as long as i see enemies of mine alive  , i would rather see my sword wound them than me  .
turn  , hellhound  , turn  !
turn around  , you dog from hell  , turn around  !
of all men else i have avoided thee  .
you are the only man i have avoided  .
but get thee back  .
but go away now  .
my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already  .
i 'm already guilty of killing your whole family  .
i have no words  .
i have nothing to say to you  .
my voice is in my sword  .
my sword will talk for me  .
thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out  !
you are too evil for words  !
then yield thee  , coward  , and live to be the show and gaze o ' th ' time  .
then surrender  , coward  , and we 'll put you in a freakshow  , just like they do with deformed animals  .
we 'll have thee  , as our rarer monsters are  , painted on a pole  , and underwrit  , here may you see the tyrant  .
we 'll put a picture of you on a sign  , right above the words come see the tyrant  !
i would the friends we miss were safe arrived  .
i wish all of our friends could have survived this battle  .
macduff is missing  , and your noble son  .
macduff is missing  , and so is your noble son  .
your son  , my lord  , has paid a soldier 's debt  .
my lord  , your son has paid the soldier 's price  : death  .
he only lived but till he was a man  , the which no sooner had his prowess confirmed in the unshrinking station where he fought  , but like a man he died  .
he only lived long enough to become a man  , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one  , he died  .
then he is dead  ?
so he 's dead  ?
ay  , and brought off the field  .
yes  , and he 's been carried off the field  .
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth  , for then it hath no end  .
your grief should not be equal to his worth  , because then your sorrow would never end  .
had he his hurts before  ?
were his wounds on his front side  ?
ay  , on the front  .
yes  , on his front  .
why then  , god 's soldier be he  !
well then  , he 's god 's soldier now  !
had i as many sons as i have hairs  , i would not wish them to a fairer death  .
if i had as many sons as i have hairs on my head  , i could n't hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did  .
and so  , his knell is knolled  .
and that 's all there is to it  .
he 's worth more sorrow  , and that i 'll spend for him  .
he is worth more mourning than that  , and i will mourn for him  .
he 's worth no more  .
he is worth no more than that  .
they say he parted well and paid his score  .
they tell me he died well  , and settled his scores  .
and so  , god be with him  !
with that  , i hope god is with him  !
here comes newer comfort  .
here comes better news  .
hail  , king  !
hail  , king  !
for so thou art  .
because that 's what you are now  .
behold where stands the usurper 's cursd head  .
look  , here i have macbeth 's cursed head  .
the time is free  .
we are free from his tyranny  .
i see thee compassed with thy kingdom 's pearl  , that speak my salutation in their minds  , whose voices i desire aloud with mine  .
i see that you have the kingdom 's noblemen around you  , and they 're thinking the same thing as me  .
hail  , king of scotland  !
i want them to join me in this loud cheer  , hail  , king of scotland  !
hail  , king of scotland  !
hail  , king of scotland  !
in sooth  , i know not why i am so sad  .
to be honest  , i do n't know why i 'm so sad  .
it wearies me  ; you say it wearies you  .
i 'm tired of it  , and you say you 're tired of it too  .
but how i caught it  , found it  , or came by it  , what stuff 't is made of  , whereof it is born  , i am to learn  .
but i have no idea how i got so depressed  .
and such a want - wit sadness makes of me  , that i have much ado to know myself  .
and if i ca n't figure out what 's making me depressed  , i must not understand myself very well  .
why then  , you are in love  .
well then  , you must be in love  .
fie  , fie  !
oh  , give me a break  .
some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper  , and other of such vinegar aspect that they 'll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable  .
some people will laugh at anything  , and others are so grouchy they wo n't even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny  .
i would have stayed till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me  .
i would 've stayed to cheer you up  , if your nobler friends had n't shown up  .
bassanio  , lorenzo  , gratiano good morrow  , my good lords  .
bassanio lorenzo gratiano good morning  , gentlemen  .
my lord bassanio  , since you have found antonio  , we two will leave you  .
bassanio  , we 'll say goodbye for now  , since you 've found antonio  .
but at dinnertime i pray you have in mind where we must meet  .
but do n't forget  , we 're meeting for dinner tonight  .
i will not fail you  .
do n't worry  , i 'll be there  .
you look not well  , signor antonio  .
you do n't look well  , antonio  .
you have too much respect upon the world  .
you 're taking things too seriously  .
they lose it that do buy it with much care  .
people with too much invested in the world always get hurt  .
believe me  , you are marvelously changed  .
i 'm telling you  , you do n't look like yourself  .
well  , we will leave you then till dinnertime  .
all right  , we 'll see you at dinnertime  .
i must be one of these same dumb wise men  , for gratiano never lets me speak  .
i must be one of these silent so - called wise men gratiano 's talking about  , because he never lets me get a word in  .
farewell  .
goodbye  .
i 'll grow a talker for this gear  .
after that lecture of yours  , i 'll start talking a lot  .
is that any thing now  ?
is he right  ?
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing  , more than any man in all venice  .
gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in venice  .
his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them  , and when you have them they are not worth the search  .
his point is always like a needle in a haystack you look for it all day  , and when you find it you realize it was n't worth the trouble  .
't is not unknown to you  , antonio  , how much i have disabled mine estate  , by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance  .
antonio  , you know how bad my finances have been lately  .
nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate  .
i 've been living way beyond my means  .
but my chief care
do n't get me wrong  , i 'm not complaining about having to cut back  .
i pray you  , good bassanio  , let me know it  .
please let me know your plan  , bassanio  .
and if it stand  , as you yourself still do  , within the eye of honor  , be assured my purse  , my person  , my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions  .
as long as it 's honorable  , you can be sure that i 'll let you use all my money and do everything i can to help you  .
by my troth  , nerissa  , my little body is aweary of this great world  .
oh nerissa  , my poor little body is tired of this great big world  .
you would be  , sweet madam  , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are  .
you 'd be tired  , madam  , if you had bad luck rather than wealth and good luck  .
and yet for aught i see  , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing  .
but as far as i can tell  , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing  .
it is no mean happiness  , therefore  , to be seated in the mean  .
the best way to be happy is to be in between  .
superfluity comes sooner by white hairs  , but competency lives longer  .
when you have too much you get old sooner  , but having just enough helps you live longer  .
good sentences  , and well pronounced  .
good point  , and well said  .
they would be better if well followed  .
it would be better if you actually applied it to your life  .
first  , there is the neapolitan prince  .
well  , first there was the prince from naples  .
then there is the county palatine  .
then there 's the count palatine  .
he doth nothing but frown  , as who should say  , an you will not have me  , choose  .
he does nothing but frown  , as if he wants to say  , if you do n't want me  , i do n't care  .
he hears merry tales and smiles not  .
he does n't even smile when he hears funny stories  .
i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old  , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth  .
if he 's so sad and solemn when he 's young  , i can only imagine how much he 'll cry as an old man  .
i had rather be married to a death's - head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these  .
no  , i 'd rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men  .
god defend me from these two  !
god protect me from these two  !
how say you by the french lord  , monsieur le bon  ?
what did you think about that french lord  , monsieur le bon  ?
what say you then to falconbridge  , the young baron of england  ?
what about falconbridge  , that young english baron  ?
what think you of the scottish lord  , his neighbor  ?
what do you think of his neighbor  , the scottish lord  ?
how like you the young german  , the duke of saxony 's nephew  ?
how did you like the young german  , the duke of saxony 's nephew  ?
very vilely in the morning  , when he is sober  , and most vilely in the afternoon  , when he is drunk  .
he 's pretty awful in the morning when he 's sobering up  , and even worse in the afternoon when he 's drunk  .
when he is best he is a little worse than a man  , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast  .
at his best he 's a little less than a man  , and at his worst he 's little more than an animal  .
and the worst fall that ever fell  , i hope i shall make shift to go without him  .
if we got married and he tragically met his demise  , i 'm sure i could find a way to go on without him  .
if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket  , you should refuse to perform your father 's will if you should refuse to accept him  .
if he offers to play the game and chooses the right box  , but then you reject him  , you 'll be disobeying your father 's last wishes  .
you need not fear  , lady  , the having any of these lords  .
you do n't have to worry about any of these lords  , my lady  .
they have acquainted me with their determinations  , which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father 's imposition depending on the caskets  .
they 've all told me what they want  , which is to go back home and give up on you unless there was some other way to win you than your father 's pick - the - box test  .
do you not remember  , lady  , in your father 's time a venetian  , a scholar and a soldier  , that came hither in company of the marquess of montferrat  ?
do you remember a venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of montferrat here once when your father was still alive  ?
true  , madam  .
yes  , madam  , that 's the one  .
he  , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon  , was the best deserving a fair lady  .
he deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men i 've ever seen  .
i remember him well  , and i remember him worthy of thy praise  .
i remember him well  , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise  .
how now  , what news  ?
hello  , do you have any news  ?
the four strangers seek for you  , madam  , to take their leave  .
the four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye  , madam  .
and there is a forerunner come from a fifth  , the prince of morocco  , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight  .
and there 's a messenger representing a fifth one  , the prince of morocco  , who says the prince will be here tonight  .
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell  , i should be glad of his approach  .
if i could say hello to the fifth one as happily as i 'll say goodbye to the first four  , i 'd be very happy he 's coming  .
if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil  , i had rather he should shrive me than wive me  .
if he 's as good as a saint but is black like a devil  , i 'd rather he hear my confession than marry me  .
come  , nerissa  .
let 's go  , nerissa  .
servant sirrah  , go before  .
servant go ahead  .
whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer another knocks at the door  .
as soon as we shut the door on one suitor  , another one starts knocking  .
three thousand ducats  , well  .
three thousand ducats  , hmmm  .
ay  , sir  , for three months  .
yes  , for three months  .
for three months  , well  .
for three months  , hmmm  .
antonio shall become bound  , well  .
antonio will guarantee it  , hmmm  .
three thousand ducats for three months  , and antonio bound  .
three thousand ducats for three months  , and antonio will guarantee it  .

antonio is a good man  .
antonio 's a good man  .

shylock  , although i never lend or borrow with interest  , i 'm willing to break that habit to help a friend in need  .
bassanio is he yet possessed how much ye would  ?
bassanio does he know how much you need  ?
ay  , ay  , three thousand ducats  .
oh yes  , three thousand ducats  .
and for three months  .
for three months  .

yes  , shylock  , i 'll sign the contract and agree to its terms  .
hie thee  , gentle jew  .

oh  , and then at the very next turn  , do n't turn left or right  , but turn down and around to the jew 's house  .
by god 's sonties  , 'twill be a hard way to hit  .
good heavens  , those are difficult directions  .
can you tell me whether one launcelot that dwells with him  , dwell with him or no  ?
can you tell me if a man named launcelot  , who lives with him  , is still there  ?
no master  , sir  , but a poor man 's son  .
he 's not a master  , sir  , he 's just a poor man 's son  .
his father  , though i say 't  , is an honest exceeding poor man and  , god be thanked  , well to live  .
his father  , if i do say so myself  , is an honest but very poor man  , and  , thank god  , likely to live a long time  .
but i pray you  , ergo  , old man  , ergo  , i beseech you  , talk you of young master launcelot  ?
but excuse me  ,  , old man  ,  , i 'm asking you if you 're talking about young master launcelot  .

morocco now make your choice  .
morocco now make your choice  .
the one of them contains my picture  , prince  .
one of them contains my picture  .
if you choose that  , then i am yours withal  .
if you choose that one  , i 'm yours  , along with the picture  .
some god direct my judgment  !
i wish some god could help me choose  !
let me see  .
let me see  .
i will survey th ' inscriptions back again  .
i 'll look over the inscriptions again  .
what says this leaden casket  ?
what does the lead box say  ?
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath  .
he who chooses me must give and risk all he has  .
must give for what  ?
must give everything for what  ?
for lead  ?
for lead  ?
hazard for lead  ?
risk everything for lead  ?
this casket threatens  .
this box is too threatening  .
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages  .
men who risk everything hope to make profits  .
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross  .
a golden mind does n't bend down to choose something worthless  .
i 'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead  .
so i wo n't give or risk anything for lead  .
what says the silver with her virgin hue  ?
what does the silver one say  ?
lies all within  .
here an angel 's lying in a golden bed  .

a gentle riddance  .
good riddance  !
draw the curtains  , go  .
close the curtains and leave  .
let all of his complexion choose me so  .
i hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice  .
he came too late  .
he got there too late  .
the ship was under sail  .
the ship was already sailing  .
but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica  .
but once he got there  , the duke learned that lorenzo and his lover jessica were together in a gondola  .
besides  , antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship  .
in any case  , antonio assured the duke they were n't with bassanio on his ship  .
why  , all the boys in venice follow him  , crying  , his stones  , his daughter  , and his ducats  !
i know  , all the boys in venice are following him  , yelling  , his stones  , his daughter  , and his ducats  !
let good antonio look he keep his day  , or he shall pay for this  .
i hope antonio repays his loan on time  , or he 'll suffer for this  .
you were best to tell antonio what you hear yet do not suddenly  , for it may grieve him  .
you should tell antonio what you hear but do n't do it suddenly  , because it might upset him  .
i think he only loves the world for him  .
i think he only loves life because of bassanio  .
i pray thee  , let us go and find him out and quicken his embracd heaviness with some delight or other  .
let 's go find him and cheer him up  .
do we so  .
yes  , let 's do that  .
to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self  .
everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules  .
too long a pause for that which you find there  .
you thought about it too long  , considering what you found there  .
what 's here  ?
what 's this  ?
the portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule  !
a picture of an idiot holding a scroll up for me to read  !
i will read it  .
i 'll read it  .
how much unlike art thou to portia  !
it looks so unlike portia  !
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings  !
this outcome is n't what i hoped for  , or what i deserve  .
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves  !
the one who chooses me will get what he deserves  !
did i deserve no more than a fool 's head  ?
did n't i deserve anything more than a fool 's head  ?
is that my prize  ?
is this my prize  ?
are my deserts no better  ?
do n't i deserve more than this  ?
the ancient saying is no heresy  .
you know what they say  .
hanging and wiving goes by destiny  .
destiny chooses when you 'll die and who you 'll marry  .
come  , draw the curtain  , nerissa  .
come on  , close the curtain  , nerissa  .
where is my lady  ?
where 's lady portia  ?
here  .
here  .
what would my lord  ?
how can i help you  , sir  ?
no more  , i pray thee  .
please do n't tell me any more  .
i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee  , thou spend'st such high - day wit in praising him  .
i 'm almost afraid you 're going to tell me he 's a relative of yours  , because you 're going so crazy praising him  .
come  , come  , nerissa  , for i long to see quick cupid 's post that comes so mannerly  .
come on  , nerissa  , i want to go see this man who 's come so courteously  .
bassanio  , lord love  , if thy will it be  !
i hope it 's bassanio coming to win portia  !
now  , what news on the rialto  ?
so  , what 's the news on the rialto  ?
why  , yet it lives there unchecked that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas  .
well  , there 's a rumor that antonio had a ship carrying expensive cargo that shipwrecked in the english channel on the goodwin sands  , a very dangerous sandbar  .
the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat  , and fatal  , where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried  , as they say  , if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word  .
many ships have sunk there  , according to rumors  .
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband  .
i hope this new rumor is a lie  , like the gossiping widow 's claim that she was sorry her third husband died  !
but it is true  , without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk  , that the good antonio  , the honest antonio oh  , that i had a title good enough to keep his name company  !
but it 's true i do n't want to get all mushy and go on and on  , but the good antonio  , the honest antonio oh  , if i only had a title good enough to match his  !
come  , the full stop  .
come on  , get to the point  .
ha  , what sayest thou  ?
what are you saying  ?
why  , the end is he hath lost a ship  .
well  , the point is  , he 's lost a ship  .
i would it might prove the end of his losses  .
i hope that 's all he loses  .
let me say amen betimes  , lest the devil cross my prayer  , for here he comes in the likeness of a jew  .
let me say amen quickly  , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer because here comes the devil  , disguised as a jew  .
how now  , shylock  ?
how 's it going  , shylock  ?
what news among the merchants  ?
what 's the news among the merchants  ?
you knew none so well  , none so well as you of my daughter 's flight  .
you knew no one knew  , no one knew as well as you did about my daughter 's plans to run away  .
that 's certain  .
that 's true  .
i  , for my part  , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal  .
i even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off  .
she is damned for it  .
she 'll be damned for it  .
that 's certain if the devil may be her judge  .
that 's true if the devil 's judging her  .
out upon it  , old carrion  !
no  !
rebels it at these years  ?
your at your age  ?
i say my daughter is my flesh and blood  .
i mean my daughter is my flesh and blood  .
there i have another bad match  !
that 's another bad deal i 've made  !
a bankrupt  , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the rialto  , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart  .
a bankrupt  , a spendthrift  , who now has to hide his head on the rialto  , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants  .
let him look to his bond  .
let him think about his own debt  .
he was wont to call me usurer  ; let him look to his bond  .
he liked to call me a loan shark  ; let him think about his debt to me  .
he was wont to lend money for a christian courtesy  ; let him look to his bond  .
he used to lend money as a favor between christians  ; but now  , let him think about his own debt  .
why  , i am sure  , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh  .
but you wo n't take his flesh if he ca n't pay  .
what 's that good for  ?
what 's that good for  ?

i started making love vows to her till my mouth was dry  .
for wooing here until i sweat again  , and swearing till my very roof was dry with oaths of love  , at last if promise last i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love  , provided that your fortune achieved her mistress  .
then finally she said she loved me and would marry me if you two got married as well  .

lorenzo and his pagan girlfriend  ?
what  , and my old venetian friend salerio  ?
what  , and my old venetian friend salerio  ?
so do i  , my lord  .
i do too  , my lord  .
they are entirely welcome  .
they 're entirely welcome  .
bassanio i thank your honor  .
bassanio thank you  , sir  .
for my part  , my lord  , my purpose was not to have seen you here  .
i did n't intend to come see you  .
but meeting with salerio by the way  , he did entreat me  , past all saying nay  , to come with him along  .
but i ran into salerio on the way  , and he begged me to come along with him until i could n't say no  .
ere i ope his letter  , i pray you tell me how my good friend doth  .
before i open this letter  , please tell me how my good friend is doing  .
not sick  , my lord  , unless it be in mind  , nor well  , unless in mind  .
he 's not sick  , my lord  , but he 's very upset  , and his problems are serious  .
his letter there will show you his estate  .
his letter will tell you how he 's doing  .
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost  .
i wish you 'd won the he lost  .
there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio 's cheek  .
something bad in that letter is making bassanio turn pale  .
some dear friend dead  , else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man  .
some good friend of his must have died  , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much  .
what  , worse and worse  ?
what  , does the news only get worse  ?
with leave  , bassanio  , i am half yourself  , and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you  .
please  , bassanio  , i 'm half of you  , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you  .
o sweet portia  , here are a few of the unpleasant'st words that ever blotted paper  .
oh portia  , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper  .
gentle lady  , when i did first impart my love to you  , i freely told you  , all the wealth i had ran in my veins  .
my darling  , when i gave my love to you  , i told you that all the wealth i had ran within my veins that i have noble blood  , but no money  .
i was a gentleman  , and then i told you true  .
when i said that  , i told you the truth  .
and yet  , dear lady  , rating myself at nothing  , you shall see how much i was a braggart  .
but my dear  , when i said i was worth nothing  , i was actually bragging i should 've said that i was worse than nothing  .
when i told you my state was nothing  , i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing  , for indeed i have engaged myself to a dear friend  , engaged my friend to his mere enemy to feed my means  .
i 've borrowed money from a dear friend who in turn borrowed money from his mortal enemy for my sake  .
here is a letter  , lady  , the paper as the body of my friend  , and every word in it a gaping wound  , issuing life blood  .
here 's a letter  , my dear  .
but is it true  , salerio  ?
the paper 's like my friend 's body  , and every word in it is a bleeding wound on that body  .
have all his ventures failed  ?
but is it true  , salerio  ?
what  , not one hit  ?
have all his business ventures failed  ?
from tripolis  , from mexico and england  , from lisbon  , barbary  , and india  ?
not even one success  ?
and not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch of merchant - marring rocks  ?
he had ships to tripolis  , mexico  , england  , lisbon  , north africa  , and india  , and not one of these ships avoided the rocks  ?
not one  , my lord  .
not one  , my lord  .
besides  , it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew  , he would not take it  .
anyway  , even if he had the money now  , the jew probably would n't take it  .
never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man  .
i 've never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man  .
he plies the duke at morning and at night  , and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice  .
he 's at the duke 's morning and night  , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice  .
twenty merchants  , the duke himself  , and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him  .
twenty merchants  , the duke himself  , and the highest - ranking venetian nobles have all tried to persuade him to forget his contract  , but nobody can do it  .
but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture  , of justice  , and his bond  .
he 's determined to get the penalty specified in his contract with antonio  .
when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus  , his countrymen  , that he would rather have antonio 's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him  .
when i was still living with him i heard him swear to tubal and cush  , his countrymen  , that he 'd rather have antonio 's flesh than twenty times the sum antonio owed  .
and i know  , my lord  , if law  , authority  , and power deny not  , it will go hard with poor antonio  .
and i know that unless the law intervenes  , it 'll be bad news for poor antonio  .
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble  ?
is this your good friend who 's in so much trouble  ?
what sum owes he the jew  ?
how much does he owe the jew  ?
for me  , three thousand ducats  .
three thousand ducats  .
what  , no more  ?
what  , that 's all  ?
pay him six thousand and deface the bond  !
pay him six thousand and cancel the debt  .
double six thousand  , and then treble that  , before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio 's fault  .
i 'd pay twelve thousand before i 'd let a friend like that suffer in the slightest because of you  .
first go with me to church and call me wife  , and then away to venice to your friend  .
first come with me to church to get married  .
for never shall you lie by portia 's side with an unquiet soul  .
then you can leave for venice to see your friend  .
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over  .
you have to go  , because you 'll never sleep next to me peacefully without settling this  .
when it is paid  , bring your true friend along  .
i 'll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over  .
my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows  .
when it 's paid  , bring your friend back  .
come  , away  !
until you get back  , nerissa and i will live like virgins and widows  .
for you shall hence upon your wedding day  .
come on  , let 's go  , because you 're going to leave me the same day we get married  .
bid your friends welcome  , show a merry cheer  .
put on a happy face  , and welcome your friends  .
since you are dear bought  , i will love you dear  .
since it 's costing me a lot to marry you  , i 'll think of you as even more precious  .
but let me hear the letter of your friend  .
but let me hear the letter from your friend  .
sweet bassanio  , my ships have all miscarried  .
dear bassanio  , my ships have all been wrecked  .
my creditors grow cruel  .
my creditors are getting mean  .
my estate is very low  .
my money 's almost run out  .
my bond to the jew is forfeit  .
i could n't pay my debt to the jew on the due date  .
and since in paying it  , it is impossible i should live  , all debts are cleared between you and i if i might but see you at my death  .
since i 'll certainly die when he takes his collateral out of my flesh  , all debts are cleared between you and me if i can just see you again before i die  .
notwithstanding  , use your pleasure  .
in any case  , do what you want  .
if your love do not persuade you to come  , let not my letter  .
if your affection for me does n't convince you to come  , do n't let my letter do so  .
o love  , dispatch all business and be gone  !
oh  , my darling  , make your arrangements and go  !
since i have your good leave to go away  , i will make haste  .
since you 're letting me leave  , i 'll hurry  .
but till i come again  , no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay  , no rest be interposer 'twixt us twain  .
but i wo n't sleep till i get back  .
jailer  , look to him  .
jailer  , watch out for this one  .
tell not me of mercy  .
do n't try to convince me to feel sorry for him  .
this is the fool that lent out money gratis  .
this is the fool who lent out money without charging interest  .
jailer  , look to him  .
jailer  , keep an eye on him  .
hear me yet  , good shylock  .
listen to me  , good shylock  .
i 'll have my bond  .
i 'm going to get my  .
speak not against my bond  .

thou calledst me dog before thou hadst a cause  .
you called me a dog before you had any reason to  .
but since i am a dog  , beware my fangs  .
but since i 'm a dog  , beware my fangs  .
the duke shall grant me justice  .
the duke will give me justice  .
i do wonder  , thou naughty jailer  , that thou art so fond to come abroad with him at his request  .
i do wonder  , jailer  , how you can be so foolish as to let this prisoner out of his cell  .
i pray thee  , hear me speak  .
please  , listen to me  .
i 'll have my bond  .
i want my bond  .
i will not hear thee speak  .
i wo n't listen to you  .
i 'll have my bond  , and therefore speak no more  .
i want my bond  , so stop talking  .
i 'll not be made a soft and dull - eyed fool to shake the head  , relent and sigh  , and yield to christian intercessors  .
i wo n't be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to christian meddlers  .
follow not  .
do n't follow me  .
i 'll have no speaking  .
i 'm not talking with you  .
i will have my bond  .
i want my bond  .
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men  .
he 's the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans  .
let him alone  .
leave him alone  .
i 'll follow him no more with bootless prayers  .
i wo n't follow him around with useless pleas anymore  .
he seeks my life  .
he wants me dead  .
his reason well i know  .
i know the real reason  .
i oft delivered from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me  .
i 've often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him  .
therefore he hates me  .
that 's why he hates me  .
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold  .
i 'm sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced  .
madam  , although i speak it in your presence  , you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity  , which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord  .
madam  , i hope you do n't mind my saying that i admire your noble respect for friendship  , which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this  .
but if you knew to whom you show this honor  , how true a gentleman you send relief  , how dear a lover of my lord your husband  , i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you  .
if you only knew the man you 're helping out  , and what a faithful gentleman he is and how much he loves your husband  , i know you 'd be even prouder of your kindness than you normally might be  .
madam  , with all my heart  .
madam  , with all my heart  .
i shall obey you in all fair commands  .
i 'll do anything you ask  .
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you  !
i hope you can relax and enjoy yourself  !
i wish your ladyship all heart 's content  .
i hope you find peace and happiness  , my lady  .
now  , balthazar  , as i have ever found thee honest true  , so let me find thee still  .

balthazar take this letter to padua as fast as you can  .
see thou render this into my cousin 's hands  , doctor bellario  .
make sure you put it into the hands of my cousin bellario  , the doctor of laws  .
madam  , i go with all convenient speed  .
i 'll go as fast as i can  , madam  .
come on  , nerissa  , i have work in hand that you yet know not of  .
come on  , nerissa  , i have many things to do that you do n't even know about yet  .
we 'll see our husbands before they think of us  .
we 'll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us  .
shall they see us  ?
will they see us  ?
why  , shall we turn to men  ?
why  , are we turning to men  ?
yes  , truly  , for look you  , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children  .
yes  , look  , it 's true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers  .
therefore i promise ye i fear you  .
that 's why i 'm worried about you  .
i was always plain with you  , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter  .
i 've always been straightforward with you  , so now i 'm telling you what i think  .
therefore be o ' good cheer  , for truly i think you are damned  .
cheer up  , because i think you 're going to hell  .
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good  , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither  .
there 's only one hope for you  , and even that 's a kind of illegitimate hope  .
and what hope is that  , i pray thee  ?
what hope is that  , may i ask  ?
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed  .
that really is an illegitimate hope  .
so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me  .
then i 'd be punished for the sins of my mother  .
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother  .
in that case i 'm afraid you 're damned by both your father and your mother  .
thus when i shun scylla your father  , i fall into charybdis your mother  .
when you avoid one trap  , you fall into another  .
well  , you are gone both ways  .
you 're in trouble either way  .
i shall be saved by my husband  .
my husband will save me  .
he hath made me a christian  .
he 's made me a christian  .

nay  , you need not fear us  , lorenzo  .
no  , you do n't need to worry about us  , lorenzo  .
launcelot and i are out  .
launcelot and i ca n't agree on anything  .
he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jew 's daughter  , and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth  , for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork  .
he says i wo n't get into heaven because i 'm a jew 's daughter  , and he says you 're irresponsible because by converting jews to christianity you 're raising the price of pork  .
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro 's belly  .
i can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with portia 's african servant  .
the moor is with child by you  , launcelot  .
the is pregnant with your child  , launcelot  .
it is much that the moor should be more than reason  .
it 's too bad there 's more of the moor than there ought to be  .
but if she be less than an honest woman  , she is indeed more than i took her for  .
well  , even if she 's a less than honest woman  , she 's still a lot respectable than i thought at first  .

as for your coming in to dinner  , just do what you feel is right  .
even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife  .
as good a wife as she is  , that 's how good a husband i am to you  .
nay  , but ask my opinion too of that  !
i 'll be the judge of that  !
i will anon  .
i 'll give you a chance to judge later  .
first let us go to dinner  .
first let 's go to dinner  .
nay  , let me praise you while i have a stomach  .

does everyone kill what they do n't love  ?
hates any man the thing he would not kill  ?
does anyone hate something and not want to kill it  ?

so shines a good deed in a naughty world  .

i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it  .
i gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away  .
and here he stands  .
and here he is  .
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters  .
i 'd swear he would n't leave it behind  , or even take it off his finger  , for all the money in the world  .
now in faith  , gratiano  , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief  .
to tell the truth  , gratiano  , you 're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset  .
an 'twere to me  , i should be mad at it  .
if it were me  , i 'd be very upset too  .
why  , i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it  .

but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it  .
but you see my finger does n't have the ring on it  .
it is gone  .
it 's gone  .
even so void is your false heart of truth  .
just as there 's no ring on your finger  , there 's no truth in your heart  .
by heaven  , i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring  .
i swear i 'll never get into your bed until i see the ring again  !
gratiano nor i in yours till i again see mine  .
gratiano me neither  , until i see mine again  !
sweet portia  , if you did know to whom i gave the ring  , if you did know for whom i gave the ring  , and would conceive for what i gave the ring  , and how unwillingly i left the ring when naught would be accepted but the ring  , you would abate the strength of your displeasure  .
my dear portia  , if you knew who i gave the ring to  , for whose sake i gave the ring to him  , why i gave it to him  , and how unwilling i was to leave it when he would n't accept anything but the ring  , you would n't be so angry  .

know him i shall  , i am well sure of it  .
i 'll recognize him all right  , i 'm sure of it  .
lie not a night from home  .

watch me like argus  .
watch me like a hawk  .
if you do not  , if i be left alone  , now  , by mine honor which is yet mine own i 'll have that doctor for my bedfellow  .
if you do n't  , if i 'm left alone  , i swear i 'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow  .
gratiano and i his clerk  .
gratiano and i 'll have his clerk as mine  .
therefore be well advised how you do leave me to mine own protection  .
so be careful when you leave me to my own devices  .
well  , do you so  , let not me take him then  .
well  , go ahead  .
for if i do i 'll mar the young clerk 's pen  .
but do n't let me catch him  , because if i do i 'll break that clerk 's pen  .
i am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels  .
all these quarrels are about me  .
sir  , grieve not you  .
do n't be upset  .
you are welcome notwithstanding  .
you 're welcome in our home in spite of everything that 's going on  .
mark you but that  !
did you hear that  !
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye  , one  .
he sees himself in my two eyes  , so there 's two of him  .
swear by your double self  , and there 's an oath of credit  !
he should swear by his two - faced self  , and that 's an oath i 'll believe  !
nay  , but hear me  .
no  , just listen to me  .
pardon this fault  , and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee  .
if you forgive my mistake  , i swear i 'll never break an oath with you again  .
by heaven  , it is the same i gave the doctor  !
my god  , it 's the same one i gave the judge  !
i had it of him  .
i got it from him  .
pardon me  , bassanio  , for by this ring  , the doctor lay with me  .
i 'm sorry  , bassanio  , but the legal expert slept with me in exchange for this ring  .
and pardon me  , my gentle gratiano  , for that same scrubbd boy  , the doctor 's clerk  , in lieu of this  , last night did lie with me  .
and i 'm sorry too  , gratiano  , but that stunted lawyer 's clerk slept with me last night in exchange for this ring  .

but were the day come  , i should wish it dark  , that i were couching with the doctor 's clerk  .
when the day comes  , i 'll wish it were nighttime  , so i could sleep with the legal expert 's clerk  .
well  , while i live i 'll fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissa 's ring  .
in any case  , i wo n't worry about anything for the rest of my life more than keeping nerissa 's ring safe  .
now  , fair hippolyta  , our nuptial hour draws on apace  .
our wedding day is almost here  , my beautiful hippolyta  .
four happy days bring in another moon  .
we 'll be getting married in four days  , on the day of the new moon  .
but oh  , methinks how slow this old moon wanes  !
but it seems to me that the days are passing too slowly the old moon is taking too long to fade away  !
she lingers my desires  , like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man 's revenue  .
that old  , slow moon is keeping me from getting what i want  , just like an old widow makes her stepson wait to get his inheritance  .
four days will quickly steep themselves in night  .
no  , you 'll see  , four days will quickly turn into four nights  .
four nights will quickly dream away the time  .
and since we dream at night  , time passes quickly then  .
and then the moon  , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven  , shall behold the night of our solemnities  .
finally the new moon  , curved like a silver bow in the sky  , will look down on our wedding celebration  .
hippolyta  , i wooed thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries  .
hippolyta  , i wooed you with violence  , using my sword  , and got you to fall in love with me by injuring you  .
but i will wed thee in another key  , with pomp  , with triumph  , and with reveling  .
but i 'll marry you under different circumstances with extravagant festivals  , public festivities  , and celebration  .
happy be theseus  , our renownd duke  .
long live theseus  , our famous and respected duke  !
thanks  , good egeus  .
thanks  , good egeus  .
what 's the news with thee  ?
what 's new with you  ?
full of vexation come i with complaint against my child  , my daughter hermia  .
i 'm here  , full of anger  , to complain about my daughter hermia  .
stand forth  , demetrius  .
step forward  , demetrius  .
my noble lord  , this man hath my consent to marry her  .
my lord  , this man  , demetrius  , has my permission to marry her  .
stand forth  , lysander  .
step forward  , lysander  .
and my gracious duke  , this man hath bewitched the bosom of my child  .
but this other man  , lysander  , has cast a magic spell over my child 's heart  .
thou  , thou  , lysander  , thou hast given her rhymes  , and interchanged love tokens with my child  .
you  , you  , lysander  , you 've given her poems  , and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter  .
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love  , and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair  , rings  , gauds  , conceits  , knacks  , trifles  , nosegays  , sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardened youth  .
you 've pretended to be in love with her  , singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight  , and you 've captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair  , rings  , toys  , trinkets  , knickknacks  , little presents  , flowers  , and candies things that can really influence an impressionable young person  .
with cunning hast thou filched my daughter 's heart  , turned her obedience  ( which is due to me  ) to stubborn harshness  .
you 've connived to steal my daughter 's heart  , making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient  ( like she should be  )  .
and  , my gracious duke  , be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius  , i beg the ancient privilege of athens  .
and  , my gracious duke  , if she wo n't agree to marry demetrius right now  , i ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in athens  .
as she is mine  , i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case  .
since she belongs to me  , i can do what i want with her as the law says  : i can either make her marry demetrius or have her killed  .
so is lysander  .
so is lysander  .
in himself he is  .
you 're right  , lysander 's admirable too  .
but in this kind  , wanting your father 's voice  , the other must be held the worthier  .
but since your father does n't want him to marry you  , you have to consider demetrius to be the better man  .
i would my father looked but with my eyes  .
i wish my father could see them with my eyes  .
rather your eyes must with his judgment look  .
no  , you must see them as your father sees them  .
so will i grow  , so live  , so die  , my lord  , ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship  , whose unwishd yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty  .
i 'd rather wither away than give up my virginity to someone i do n't love  .
with duty and desire we follow you  .
we 're following you not only because it is our duty  , but also because we want to  .
how now  , my love  ?
what 's going on  , my love  ?
why is your cheek so pale  ?
why are you so pale  ?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast  ?
why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly  ?
belike for want of rain  , which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes  .
probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain  , which i could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes  .
ay me  !
oh  , honey  !
for aught that i could ever read  , could ever hear by tale or history  , the course of true love never did run smooth  .
listen  , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles  .
but either it was different in blood
either the lovers have different social standings
o cross  !
oh  , what an obstacle that would be  !
too high to be enthralled to low  .
imagine being too high on the social ladder  , and falling in love with someone beneath you  .
or else misgraffd in respect of years
or else they were very different ages
o spite  !
how awful  !
too old to be engaged to young  .
being too old to marry someone young  .
or else it stood upon the choice of friends
or else their guardians and advisors said no
o hell  , to choose love by another 's eyes  !
what hell  , to have your love life determined by someone else  !
keep promise  , love  .
keep your promise  , my love  .
look  , here comes helena  .
look  , here comes helena  .
godspeed  , fair helena  !
hello  , beautiful helena  !
whither away  ?
where are you going  ?
o  , teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius ' heart  .
oh  , teach me how you look the way you do  , and which tricks you used to make demetrius fall in love with you  .
i frown upon him  , yet he loves me still  .
i frown at him  , but he still loves me  .
oh  , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill  !
oh  , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns  !
i give him curses  , yet he gives me love  .
i curse him  , but he loves me  .
oh  , that my prayers could such affection move  !
if only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection  !
the more i hate  , the more he follows me  .
the more i hate him  , the more he follows me around  .
the more i love  , the more he hateth me  .
the more i love him  , the more he hates me  .
his folly  , helena  , is no fault of mine  .
it 's not my fault he acts like that  , helena  .
none  , but your beauty  .
that 's true  , it 's your beauty 's fault  .
would that fault were mine  !
i wish i had a fault like that  !
take comfort  .
do n't worry  .
he no more shall see my face  .
he wo n't see my face ever again  .
lysander and myself will fly this place  .
lysander and i are running away from here  .
before the time i did lysander see seemed athens as a paradise to me  .
before i saw lysander  , athens seemed like paradise to me  .
oh  , then  , what graces in my love do dwell  , that he hath turned a heaven unto a hell  !
but lysander 's so attractive that he 's turned heaven into hell  !
helen  , to you our minds we will unfold  .
helena  , we 'll tell you about our secret plan  .
tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass  , decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass  ( a time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal  )  , through athens ' gates have we devised to steal  .
tomorrow night  , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light  ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers  )  , we plan to sneak out of athens  .
helena and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie  , emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet  ,
helena in the woods where you and i used to lounge around on the pale primroses  , telling each other sweet secrets that 's where lysander and i will meet  .
i will  , my hermia  .
i will  , my hermia  .
helena  , adieu  .
goodbye  , helena  .
as you on him  , demetrius dote on you  !
i hope demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him  !
and when this hail some heat from hermia felt  , so he dissolved  , and showers of oaths did melt  .
but when he got all hot and bothered over hermia  , his promises melted away  .
i will go tell him of fair hermia 's flight  .
i 'll go tell demetrius that hermia is running away tomorrow night  .
then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her  .
he 'll run after her  .
and for this intelligence if i have thanks  , it is a dear expense  .
if he 's grateful to me for this information  , it 'll be worth my pain in helping him pursue my rival hermia  .
but herein mean i to enrich my pain  , to have his sight thither and back again  .
at least i 'll get to see him when he goes  , and then again when he comes back  .
is all our company here  ?
is everyone here  ?
you were best to call them generally  , man by man  , according to the scrip  .
you should call their names one person at a time  , in the order in which their names appear on this piece of paper  .

i will roar  , that i will make the duke say  , let him roar again  .
i 'll roar so well that the duke will say  , let him roar again  .
let him roar again  .
let him roar again  .
an you should do it too terribly  , you would fright the duchess and the ladies  , that they would shriek  .
if you roar too ferociously  , you 'll scare the duchess and the other ladies and make them scream  .
and that were enough to hang us all  .
and that would get us all executed  .
that would hang us  , every mother 's son  .
yeah  , that would get every single one of us executed  .
i grant you  , friends  , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits  , they would have no more discretion but to hang us  .
well  , my friends  , you 've got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies  , they 'd have no choice but to execute us  .
but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove  .
but i 'll soften my voice you know  , it  , so to speak so that i 'll roar as gently as a baby dove  .
i will roar you an 'twere any nightingale  .
i 'll roar like a sweet  , peaceful nightingale  .

how now  , spirit  ?
hello  , spirit  !
whither wander you  ?
where are you going  ?
and now they never meet in grove or green  , by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen  .
and now oberon and titania refuse to speak to each other  , or meet each other anywhere neither in the forest nor on the plain  , nor by the river nor under the stars  .
but they do square  , that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there  .
they always argue  , and the little fairies get so frightened that they hide in acorn cups and wo n't come out  .
and here my mistress  .
and here 's my mistress  , titania  .
would that he were gone  !
i wish he 'd go away  !
ill met by moonlight  , proud titania  .
how nice to see you  , titania  .
what  , jealous oberon  ?
what  , are you jealous  , oberon  ?
fairies  , skip hence  .
fairies  , let 's get out of here  .
i have forsworn his bed and company  .
i 've sworn i 'll never sleep with him or talk to him again  .
tarry  , rash wanton  .
wait just a minute  , you brazen hussy  .
am not i thy lord  ?
are n't you supposed to obey me  , your lord and husband  ?
then i must be thy lady  .
if you 're my lord and husband  , i must be your lady and wife  , so you 're supposed to be faithful to me  .
but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairyland  , and in the shape of corin sat all day  , playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida  .
but i know for a fact that you snuck away from fairyland disguised as a shepherd  , and spent all day playing straw pipes and singing love poems to your new girlfriend  .
why art thou here  , come from the farthest step of india  ?
the only reason you left india was to come here and see that butch amazon hippolyta  .
but that  , forsooth  , the bouncing amazon  , your buskined mistress and your warrior love  , to theseus must be wedded  , and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity  .
she was your boot - wearing mistress and your warrior lover  , and now that she 's getting married to theseus  , you 've come to celebrate their marriage  .
how canst thou thus for shame  , titania  , knowing i know thy love to theseus  ?
how can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and hippolyta  , when you know that i know about your love for theseus  ?
glance at my credit with hippolyta  , didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigouna  , whom he ravishd  ?
were n't you the one who made him desert perigouna in the middle of the night  , right after he 'd raped her  ?
and make him with fair gles break his faith  , with ariadne and antiopa  ?
and were n't you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends  , like aegles  , ariadne  , and antiopa  ?
do you amend it then  .

it lies in you  .
you have the power to fix it  .
why should titania cross her oberon  ?
why would titania want to argue with her oberon  ?
i do but beg a little changeling boy  , to be my henchman  .
all i 'm asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew  .
how long within this wood intend you stay  ?
how long do you plan to stay here in this forest  ?
perchance till after theseus ' wedding day  .
maybe until after theseus 's wedding day  .
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels  , go with us  .
if you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations  , then you can come with us  .
if not  , shun me  , and i will spare your haunts  .
if not  , leave me alone  , and i 'll stay away from your turf  .
give me that boy and i will go with thee  .
give me that boy and i 'll come with you  .
not for thy fairy kingdom  .
not for your entire fairy kingdom  .

we shall chide downright  , if i longer stay  .
we 're going to have an out - and - out brawl if i stay any longer  .
well  , go thy way  .
well  , go on your way  , then  .
thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury  .
you wo n't leave this grove until i 've paid you back for this insult  .
robin goodfellow my gentle puck  , come hither  .
robin goodfellow my dear puck  , come here  .
thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the seamaid 's music  ?
you remember the time when i was sitting on a cliff  , and i heard a mermaid sitting on a dolphin 's back sing such a sweet and harmonious song that it calmed the stormy sea and made stars shoot out of the sky so they could hear her better  ?
i remember  .
yes  , i remember  .
i 'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes  .
i could go around the world in forty minutes  .
i love thee not  , therefore pursue me not  .
look  , i do n't love you  , so stop following me around  .
where is lysander and fair hermia  ?
where are lysander and beautiful hermia  ?
the one i 'll stay  , the other stayeth me  .
lysander i want to stop  , but hermia stops my heart from beating  .
thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood  .
you told me they escaped into this forest  .
and here am i  , and wood within this wood  , because i can not meet my hermia  .
and here i am  , going crazy in the middle of the woods because i ca n't find my hermia  .
hence  , get thee gone  , and follow me no more  .
go away  , get out of here  , and stop following me  .
you draw me  , you hard - hearted adamant  .
you attract me to you  , you cruel magnet  !
but yet you draw not iron  , for my heart is true as steel  .
but you must not attract iron  , because my heart is as true as steel  .
leave you your power to draw  , and i shall have no power to follow you  .
if you let go of your power to attract me  , i wo n't have any power to follow you  .
do i entice you  ?
do i ask you to follow me  ?
do i speak you fair  ?
do i speak to you kindly  ?
or rather  , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not  , nor i can not  , love you  ?
do n't i tell you in the clearest terms that i do not and can not love you  ?
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit  .
do n't push it  .
for i am sick when i do look on thee  .
just looking at you makes me sick  .
and i am sick when i look not on you  .
and i get sick when i ca n't look at you  .
i 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes  , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts  .
i 'll run away from you and hide in the bushes  , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals  .
i will not stay thy questions  .
i 'm not sticking around to listen to you any longer  .
let me go  .
leave me alone  .
or if thou follow me  , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood  .
or if you follow me  , you 'd better understand that i 'll do something bad to you in the forest  .
fare thee well  , nymph  .
goodbye  , nymph  .
ere he do leave this grove  , thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love  .
before he leaves this part of the forest  , you 'll change places  : you 'll be the one running away  , and he 'll be in love with you  .
hast thou the flower there  ?
do you have the flower  ?
welcome  , wanderer  .
welcome  , traveler  .
ay  , there it is  .
yes  , here it is  .
there sleeps titania sometime of the night  , lulled in these flowers with dances and delight  .
titania sleeps there sometimes at night  , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights  .
and there the snake throws her enameled skin  , weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in  .
snakes shed their skin there  , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in  .
and with the juice of this i 'll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies  .
i 'll put the juice of this flower on titania 's eyes  , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires  .
robin take thou some of it and seek through this grove  : a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth  .
robin you take some of it too  , and look around in this part of the forest  .
anoint his eyes  .
a sweet athenian lady is in love with a young man who wants nothing to do with her  .
but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady  .
put some of this flower 's juice on his eyes  , and make sure to do it in such a way that the next thing he sees will be the lady  .
thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on  .
you 'll be able to tell it 's him because he 's wearing athenian clothes  .
effect it with some care  , that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love  .
do it carefully  , so that he 'll end up loving her more than she loves him  .
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow  .
and then make sure to meet me before the rooster 's first crow at dawn  .
fear not  , my lord  .
do n't worry  , sir  .
your servant shall do so  .
i 'm at your service  .
come now  , a roundel and a fairy song  .
come  , dance in a circle and sing a fairy song  , and then go off for a while to do your work  .
then for the third part of a minute  , hence some to kill cankers in the musk - rose buds  , some war with reremice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats  , and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits  .
some of you will kill the worms infesting the rosebuds  , some of you will fight with bats to get their leathery wings  , so we can make coats for my small elves  .
sing me now asleep  .
some of you will keep that loud owl away  , the one that hoots and wonders every night at us dainty fairies  .
then to your offices and let me rest  .
sing me to sleep now  , and then go off to do your duties and let me rest  .
 .
 .
hence  , away  !
okay  , let 's go  !
now all is well  .
everything 's fine now  .
one aloof stand sentinel  .
one of us will stay and stand guard  .
titania what thou seest when thou dost wake  , do it for thy true love take  .
titania whatever you see first when you wake up  , think of it as your true love  .
love and languish for his sake  .
love him and yearn for him  , even if he 's a lynx  , a cat  , a bear  , a leopard  , or a wild boar  .
be it ounce or cat or bear  , pard or boar with bristled hair  , in thy eye that shall appear  , when thou wakest  , it is thy dear  .
whatever 's there when you wake up will be dear to you  .
wake when some vile thing is near  .
wake up when something nasty is nearby  .
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both  .
we can both sleep together on the grass  .
one heart  , one bed  , two bosoms  , and one troth  .
we 'll have one heart  , one bed  , two bodies  , and one faithful vow  .
nay  , good lysander  .
no  , lysander  .
for my sake  , my dear  , lie further off yet  .
please  , for my sake  , sleep a little farther away  .
do not lie so near  .
do n't sleep so close to me  .
o  , take the sense  , sweet  , of my innocence  .
oh  , sweetheart  , i did n't mean anything naughty when i said that  .
love takes the meaning in love 's conference  .
when lovers talk to each other  , their hearts should understand each other  .
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it  .
i just meant that our hearts are joined  , so we can almost think of them as one heart  .
two bosoms interchaind with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth  .
our two bodies are linked together by the promises we 've made to each other  , so there are two bodies and one faithful vow  .
then by your side no bed room me deny  .
so let me sleep next to you  .
for  , lying so  , hermia  , i do not lie  .
if i lie to you  , i wo n't lie you i 'll be faithful and respect you  .
amen  , amen to that fair prayer  , say i .
amen to that  .
and then end life when i end loyalty  !
i hope my life ends before my loyalty to you does  .
here is my bed  .
i 'll sleep over here  .
sleep give thee all his rest  !

who will not change a raven for a dove  ?
who would n't love a dove more than a crow  ?
the will of man is by his reason swayed  , and reason says you are the worthier maid  .
a man 's desires are influenced by his logical mind  , and it 's simply logical that you 're more worthy of love than hermia is  .

a privilege never to see me more  .
the privilege of never seeing me again  .

you 'll never see me again  , whether or not he 's dead  .
robin what hast thou done  ?
robin what have you done  ?
thou hast mistaken quite  , and laid the love juice on some true love 's sight  .
you 've made a mistake and put the love - juice on someone else  , someone who was truly in love  .
of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turned  , and not a false turned true  .
because of your mistake someone 's true love must have turned bad  , instead of this man 's false love being turned into a true love  .

why should you think that i should woo in scorn  ?
why do you think i 'm making fun of you when i tell you i love you  ?
scorn and derision never come in tears  .
people do n't cry when they 're mocking someone  .
i had no judgment when to her i swore  .
i was n't thinking clearly when i made those promises to her  .
nor none  , in my mind  , now you give her o'er  .
and i do n't believe you 're thinking clearly now  , as you break those promises  .
demetrius loves her  , and he loves not you  .
demetrius loves her  , and he does n't love you  .
to vow  , and swear  , and superpraise my parts  , when i am sure you hate me with your hearts  .
hermia 's love  , and now you 're competing to see which one of you can make fun of me the most  .
you both are rivals  , and love hermia  , and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit  , a manly enterprise  , to conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes with your derision  !
that 's a great idea  , a really manly thing to do making a poor girl cry  !
none of noble sort would so offend a virgin  , and extort a poor soul 's patience  , all to make you sport  .
no respectable person would offend an innocent girl just to have some fun  .
never did mockers waste more idle breath  .
nobody 's ever gone to so much trouble just to make fun of someone  .
helen  , it is not so  .
helena  , it 's not true  .
thou art not by mine eye  , lysander  , found  .
i could n't see you  , lysander  , but i heard your voice  , and that 's how i found you  .
mine ear  , i thank it  , brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so  ?
why did you leave me alone so unkindly  ?
why should he stay  , whom love doth press to go  ?
why stay when love tells you to go  ?
what love could press lysander from my side  ?
but what love could make my lysander leave me  ?
lysander 's love  , that would not let him bide  , fair helena  , who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light  .
i had to hurry to my love  , beautiful helena  , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars  .
why seek'st thou me  ?
why are you looking for me  ?
could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so  ?
did n't you figure out that i left you because i hate you  ?
you speak not as you think  .
you ca n't mean what you 're saying  .
it can not be  .
it 's impossible  .
so  , with two seeming bodies but one heart  , two of the first  , like coats in heraldry  , due but to one and crownd with one crest  .
we seemed to have two separate bodies  , but we had one heart  .
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend  ?
do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend  ?
it is not friendly  , 't is not maidenly  .
it 's not friendly  , and it 's not ladylike  .
our sex  , as well as i  , may chide you for it  , though i alone do feel the injury  .
all women would be angry with you for doing it  , even though i 'm the only one who 's hurt by it  .
i am amazd at your passionate words  .
i 'm completely dumbfounded by what you 're saying  .
i scorn you not  .
i 'm not insulting you  .
it seems that you scorn me  .
it sounds more like you 're insulting me  .
i understand not what you mean by this  .
i do n't know what you 're talking about  .
stay  , gentle helena  .
stay  , lovely helena  .
hear my excuse  .
listen to my excuse  .
my love  , my life  , my soul  , fair helena  !
my love  , my life  , my soul  , beautiful helena  !
oh  , excellent  !
that 's a good one  .
lysander sweet  , do not scorn her so  .
lysander do n't insult her like that  , lysander darling  .
if she can not entreat  , i can compel  .
lysander if hermia 's begging ca n't make you stop insulting helena  , i can force you to do so  .
thou canst compel no more than she entreat  .
you ca n't force me any more than hermia can beg me  .
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers  .
your threats are no stronger than her whining  .
helen  , i love thee  .
helena  , i love you  .
by my life  , i do  .
i swear i do  .
i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not  .
i 'll give my life for you  , just to prove this guy wrong when he says i do n't love you  .
i say i love thee more than he can do  .
i say that i love you more than he does  .
if thou say so  , withdraw and prove it too  .
if that 's what you say  , go fight a duel with me and prove it  .
lysander  , whereto tends all this  ?
lysander  , where are you going with all this  ?
hermia away  , you ethiope  !
hermia get away  , you african  !
hermia no  , no  .
hermia no  , no  .
he 'll seem to break loose  .
he 'll act like he 's going to break free from you  , hermia  .
lysander take on as you would follow  , but yet come not  .
lysander pretend like you 're going to follow me  , but then do n't come  .
you are a tame man  , go  !
you 're a coward  , get out of here  !
hermia hang off  , thou cat  , thou burr  !
hermia stop hanging on me  , you cat  , you thorn  .
vile thing  , let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent  .
let go of me  , or i 'll shake you off like a snake  .
why are you grown so rude  ?
why have you gotten so rude  ?
what change is this  , sweet love  ?
what 's happened to you  , my darling  ?
thy love  ?
your darling  ?
out  , tawny tartar  , out  !
get out  , you dark - skinned gypsy  !
out  , loathd medicine  !
get out  , you horrible poison  .

do you not jest  ?
are you joking  ?
yes  , sooth  , and so do you  .
of course he is  , and so are you  .
demetrius  , i will keep my word with thee  .
demetrius  , i 'm ready to fight you as promised  .
ay  , by my life  , and never did desire to see thee more  .
i certainly did  , and i never wanted to see you again  .
therefore be out of hope  , of question  , of doubt  .
so stop hoping and wondering what i mean  .
lysander demetrius i pray you  , though you mock me  , gentlemen  , let her not hurt me  .
lysander demetrius please do n't let her hurt me  , gentlemen  , however much you want to tease me  .
i was never cursed  .
i never was much good with insults  .
i have no gift at all in shrewishness  .
i 'm not mean and catty like her  .
i am a right maid for my cowardice  .
i 'm a nice shy girl  .
let her not strike me  .
please do n't let her hit me  .
you perhaps may think  , because she is something lower than myself  , that i can match her  .
maybe you think that because she 's shorter than me i can take her  .
lower  ?
shorter  !
hark  , again  !
see  , she 's doing it again  !
why  , get you gone  !
well  , get out of here then  !
who is 't that hinders you  ?
what 's keeping you  ?
a foolish heart  , that i leave here behind  .
my stupid heart  , which i 'm leaving behind here  .
what  , with lysander  ?
what  , you 're leaving it with lysander  ?
with demetrius  .
no  , with demetrius  .
be not afraid  .
do n't be afraid  .
she shall not harm thee  , helena  .
she ca n't hurt you  , helena  .
lysander no  , sir  , she shall not  , though you take her part  .
lysander that 's right  , hermia wo n't hurt helena even if you try to help her  .
oh  , when she 's angry  , she is keen and shrewd  !
oh  , when you get her angry  , she 's a good fighter  , and vicious too  .
she was a vixen when she went to school  .
she was a hellcat in school  .
and though she be but little  , she is fierce  .
and she 's fierce  , even though she 's little  .
hermia get you gone  , you dwarf  , you minimus of hindering knotgrass made  , you bead  , you acorn  !
hermia get lost  , you dwarf  , you tiny little weed  , you scrap  , you acorn  !
you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services  .
you 're doing too much to defend a woman who wants nothing to do with you  .
let her alone  .
leave hermia alone  .
speak not of helena  .
do n't talk about helena  .
take not her part  .
do n't take helena 's side  .
for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her  , thou shalt aby it  .
if you continue treating hermia so badly  , you 'll pay for it  .
now she holds me not  .
hermia 's not holding onto me anymore  .
now follow  , if thou darest  , to try whose right  , of thine or mine  , is most in helena  .
follow me if you 're brave enough  , and we 'll fight over helena  .
follow  ?
follow  ?
nay  , i 'll go with thee  , cheek by jowl  .
no  , i 'll walk right next to you  , side by side  .
you  , mistress  , all this coil is long of you  .
all this fighting is because of you  .
nay  , go not back  .
stay where you are  .
i will not trust you  , i  , nor longer stay in your curst company  .
i 'm not sticking around here any more  .
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray  .
i do n't trust you  .
my legs are longer though  , to run away  .
you might be a better fighter than i am  , but my legs are longer and i can run away faster  .
robin this is thy negligence  .
robin this is all your fault  .
still thou mistakest  , or else committ'st thy knaveries willfully  .
you make mistakes constantly  , or else you cause this kind of trouble on purpose  .
believe me  , king of shadows  , i mistook  .
believe me  , king of illusions  , i made a mistake  .
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment he had on  ?
did n't you tell me that i 'd be able to recognize the man by the athenian clothes he was wearing  ?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise  , that i have 'nointed an athenian 's eyes  .
so far i 've done exactly what i was supposed to do i put the love potion on an athenian 's eyes  .
and so far am i glad it so did sort  , as this their jangling i esteem a sport  .
and so far i 'm pleased with the way things have turned out  , since i find all of this commotion very entertaining  .
up and down  , up and down  , i will lead them up and down  .

where art thou  , proud demetrius  ?
where are you  , demetrius  , you arrogant bastard  ?
speak thou now  .

i will be with thee straight  .
i 'm coming  .
demetrius follow me then to plainer ground  .
demetrius let 's go to a flatter area where we can fight more easily  .
lysander  , speak again  !
lysander  , say something  !
thou runaway  , thou coward  , art thou fled  ?
you coward  , did you run away from me  ?

where dost thou hide thy head  ?
where are you hiding  ?
lysander thou coward  , art thou bragging to the stars  , telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars  , and wilt not come  ?
lysander you coward  , are you bragging to the stars and telling the bushes that you want a fight  , but then you wo n't come and fight me  ?

i 'll whip thee with a rod  .
i 'll beat you with a stick  .

yea  , art thou there  ?
are you there  ?
lysander follow my voice  .
lysander follow my voice  .
we 'll try no manhood here  .
this is n't a good place to fight  .
he goes before me and still dares me on  .
he 's walking ahead of me  , and he keeps daring me to follow him  .
when i come where he calls  , then he is gone  .
when i reach the place he 's calling from  , he disappears  .
the villain is much lighter - heeled than i .
this villain is much quicker than i am  .
i followed fast  , but faster he did fly  , that fallen am i in dark uneven way  ,
i ran after him fast  , but he ran away from me faster  , so that now here i am in some dark part of the forest where the ground is uneven  .
and here will rest me  .
i 'll rest here  .
come  , thou gentle day  !
i hope the pleasant daytime comes soon  !
for if but once thou show me thy grey light  , i 'll find demetrius and revenge this spite  .
as soon as the gray light of early morning appears  , i 'll find demetrius and get my revenge for this insult  .

while we 're walking  , you can tell me how i ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night  .
we will  , fair queen  , up to the mountain 's top  , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction  .
my beautiful queen  , we 'll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music  .
the skies  , the fountains  , every region near seemed all one mutual cry  .
the forests  , the skies  , the mountains  , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds  .
i never heard so musical a discord  , such sweet thunder  .
i 'd never heard such raucous music  , such pleasant thunder  .
no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may  , and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity  .
they probably woke up early to celebrate may day and came here for my celebration when they heard i 'd be here  .
but speak  , egeus  .
but tell me  , egeus  .

lysander demetrius i know you two are rival enemies  .
lysander demetrius i know you two are enemies  .
how comes this gentle concord in the world  , that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity  ?
has the world really become so gentle and peaceful that people who hate each other have started to trust each other and sleep beside each other without being afraid  ?
my lord  , i shall reply amazdly  , half sleep  , half waking  .
my lord  , what i say may be a little confused  , since i 'm half asleep and half awake  .
but as yet  , i swear  , i can not truly say how i came here  .
i swear  , at the moment i really could n't tell you how i ended up here  .
but as i think for truly would i speak  , and now do i bethink me  , so it is i came with hermia hither  .
but i think i want to tell you the truth  , and now that i think about it  , i think this is true i came here with hermia  .
our intent was to be gone from athens  , where we might  , without the peril of the athenian law
we were planning to leave athens to escape the athenian law and
theseus my lord  , fair helen told me of their stealth  , of this their purpose hither to this wood  .
theseus my lord  , the beautiful helena told me about their secret plan to escape into this forest  .

three and three  , we 'll hold a feast in great solemnity  .
we three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast  .

and he did bid us follow to the temple  .
and he told us to follow him to the temple  .

i have had a most rare vision  .
what a weird dream i had  .
i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was  .
you ca n't even describe such a weird dream  .
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream  .
you 'd be an ass if you even tried to explain it  .
methought i was there is no man can tell what  .
i thought i was no  , nobody can even describe what i was  .
methought i was  , and methought i had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had  .
i thought i was  , i thought i had but a person would be an idiot to try to say what i thought i had  .
the eye of man hath not heard  , the ear of man hath not seen  , man 's hand is not able to taste  , his tongue to conceive  , nor his heart to report what my dream was  .
no eye has ever heard  , no ear has ever seen  , no hand has tasted  , or tongue felt  , or heart described what my dream was like  .
i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream  .
i 'll get peter quince to write this dream down as a ballad  .
it shall be called bottom 's dream because it hath no bottom  .
i 'll call it bottom 's dream because it 's so deep that it has no bottom  .
and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke  .
and i 'll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play  .
peradventure  , to make it the more gracious  , i shall sing it at her death  .
or maybe  , to make it even more lovely  , i 'll sing it when the heroine dies  .
have you sent to bottom 's house  ?
have you sent anyone to bottom 's house  ?
is he come home yet  ?
has he come home yet  ?
he can not be heard of  .
no one 's heard from him  .
out of doubt he is transported  .
i 'm sure he 's been kidnapped  .
if he come not  , then the play is marred  .
if he does n't show up  , the play is ruined  .
it goes not forward  .
it wo n't go on  .
doth it  ?
will it  ?
it is not possible  .
no  , it would be impossible  .
you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he  .
he 's the only person in athens who can play pyramus  .
yea  , and the best person too  .
yes  , and the best looking too  .
and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice  .
and his voice is the paramour of sweetness  .
you must say paragon  .
you mean paragon  .
a paramour is  , god bless us  , a thing of naught  .
a is something bad  .
o sweet bully bottom  !
oh that great  , funny guy  , bottom  !
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life  .
he would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life  .
he could not have 'scaped sixpence a day  .
six pence a day would 've been forced on him  .
an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus  , i 'll be hanged  .
i 'll be damned if the duke would n't have given him six pence a day for playing pyramus  .
he would have deserved it  .
and he would have deserved it too  .
sixpence a day in pyramus  , or nothing  .
pyramus is worth or it 's worth nothing  !
where are these lads  ?
where are my guys  ?
where are these hearts  ?
where are my good fellows  ?
bottom  !
bottom  !
o most courageous day  !
oh  , how wonderful to see you  !
o most happy hour  !
oh  , what a relief  !
let us hear  , sweet bottom  .
tell us  , bottom  .
not a word of me  .
no  , you wo n't get a word out of me  .
all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined  .
all i 'll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already  .
get your apparel together  , good strings to your beards  , new ribbons to your pumps  .
now it 's time to get your costumes together  .
meet presently at the palace  .
find some good strings for tying on your false beards  , and grab new ribbons to decorate your shoes  .
every man look o'er his part  .
meet me at the palace as soon as possible  .
for the short and the long is  , our play is preferred  .
look over your lines again  .
in any case  , let thisbe have clean linen  .
our play 's going to be performed for the duke  !
and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails  , for they shall hang out for the lion 's claws  .
so make sure thisbe 's wearing clean underwear  , and make sure whoever 's playing the lion does n't cut his nails  , because he needs them long to look like lion 's claws  .
and most dear actors  , eat no onions nor garlic  , for we are to utter sweet breath  .
and no one eat any onions or garlic  .
and i do not doubt but to hear them say  , it is a sweet comedy  .
if we have sweet - smelling breath  , i 'm sure they 'll say it 's a sweet play  .
no more words  .
now no more talking  .
away  , go away  !
get busy  , go  !
't is strange  , my theseus  , that these lovers speak of  .
these lovers are saying some strange things  , theseus  .
here come the lovers  , full of joy and mirth  .
here come the lovers  , laughing happily  .
joy  , gentle friends  !
i wish you joy  , my friends  !
joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts  !
i hope the days ahead are full of joy for you  .
more than to us wait in your royal walks  , your board  , your bed  !
we wish you even more joy  , and hope joy comes to you in your royal walks  , at your table  , and in your royal bed  !
come now  , what masques  , what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after - supper and bedtime  ?
now  , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime  ?
where is our usual manager of mirth  ?
where is our entertainment director  ?
what revels are in hand  ?
what performances have been prepared  ?
is there no play  , to ease the anguish of a torturing hour  ?
are n't there any plays for us to enjoy while we wait in torture for bedtime to come  ?
call philostrate  .
let me see philostrate  .
here  , mighty theseus  .
here i am  , theseus  .
say  , what abridgement have you for this evening  ?
tell us what entertainment you 've prepared for the evening  .
what masque  , what music  ?
which plays  , what music  ?
how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight  ?
how will we pass the time without some entertainment  ?
theseus there is a brief  , how many sports are ripe  .
theseus here 's a list of all of the acts that have been prepared  .
make choice of which your highness will see first  .
choose which one you want to see first  .
the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning  , late deceased in beggary  .
thebes  .
that is some satire  , keen and critical  , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony  .
the nine muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship  .
a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe  .
that 's some sharp  , critical satire  , and it 's not appropriate for a wedding  .
very tragical mirth  .
a tedious short drama about young pyramus and his love thisbe  , a very sad and tragic comedy  .
merry and tragical  ?
a sad comedy  ?
tedious and brief  ?
short but still tedious  ?
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow  .
that 's like hot ice and strange snow  .
how shall we find the concord of this discord  ?
how can this drama be so many contradictory things  ?
a play there is  , my lord  , some ten words long  , which is as brief as i have known a play  .
it 's a play about ten words long  , which is the shortest play i 've ever heard of  .
but by ten words  , my lord  , it is too long  , which makes it tedious  .
but in my opinion  , it 's about ten words too long  .
for in all the play there is not one word apt  , one player fitted  .
that 's why it 's tedious  .
and tragical  , my noble lord  , it is  .
in the entire play  , not one word is well - written  , and not one of the actors is right for his part  .
for pyramus therein doth kill himself  .
it 's tragic because pyramus kills himself  .
which  , when i saw rehearsed  , i must confess  , made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed  .
i have to admit that when i saw his suicide during rehearsal  , i had tears in my eyes but they were tears of laughter  .
what are they that do play it  ?
who are the actors  ?
and we will hear it  .
so let 's see it  .
no  , my noble lord  .
no  , my noble lord  .
it is not for you  .
this play is n't right for you  .
i have heard it over  , and it is nothing  , nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents  , extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain to do you service  .
i 've seen the whole thing  , and it 's completely worthless unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines which they memorized so painfully are funny  .
i will hear that play  .
i 'll watch this play  .
for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it  .
nothing can really be bad when it 's created by simple people who try hard  .
go  , bring them in  .
come on  , bring them in  .
and take your places  , ladies  .
and sit down  , ladies  .
i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged and duty in his service perishing  .
i do n't like seeing poor people overburdened or looking bad when they 're trying to do something good  .
why  , gentle sweet  , you shall see no such thing  .
you wo n't see anything like that  , sweetheart  .
he says they can do nothing in this kind  .
he just said that they 're no good at acting  .
the kinder we  , to give them thanks for nothing  .
then we 're even kinder people for thanking them for something that they 're not good at  .
our sport shall be to take what they mistake  .
we 'll entertain ourselves by accepting their mistakes  .
and what poor duty can not do  , noble respect takes it in might  , not merit  .
when poor dutiful people ca n't do certain things well  , generous people can consider the effort they put into it rather than the effect that they produce  .
where i have come  , great clerks have purposd to greet me with premeditated welcomes  , where i have seen them shiver and look pale  , make periods in the midst of sentences  , throttle their practiced accent in their fears  , and in conclusion dumbly have broke off  , not paying me a welcome  .
in my travels  , great scholars have come up to me  , meaning to greet me with well - rehearsed welcoming speeches  , and i have seen them tremble and turn pale  , and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences  , and botch their well - rehearsed tones of voice because they 're so nervous  , and then break off abruptly at the end  , without actually welcoming me  .
trust me  , sweet  , out of this silence yet i picked a welcome  , and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence  .
trust me  , my sweet  , i figured out that they were trying to welcome me even though they were silent  , and that message was as clear from someone who was modest and nervously dutiful as it is from someone who is loud and audacious and eloquent  .
love  , therefore  , and tongue - tied simplicity in least speak most  , to my capacity  .
therefore  , love and tongue - tied simplicity can say the most even when they 're saying the least  , in my opinion  .
so please your grace  , the prologue is addressed  .
your grace  , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready  .
let him approach  .
let him come forward  .
this fellow doth not stand upon points  .
this guy does n't pay much attention to punctuation  .
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt  .
he rode that prologue like a wild horse  .
he knows not the stop  .
he did n't know how to stop it  .
a good moral  , my lord  : it is not enough to speak  , but to speak true  .
the moral of this story is that it 's not enough to speak  ; you have to speak grammatically  .
indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound  , but not in government  .
yes  , he performed his prologue like a child plays a recorder he can make sounds  , but they 're out of control  .
his speech was like a tangled chain  .
his speech was like a tangled chain  .
nothing impaired  , but all disordered  .
it went on and on and was a total mess  .
who is next  ?
who 's next  ?
i wonder if the lion be to speak  .
i wonder if the lion 's going to talk  .
no wonder  , my lord  .
it would n't surprise me  , my lord  .
one lion may when many asses do  .
if these asses can speak  , a lion should be able to  .
would you desire lime and hair to speak better  ?
can you imagine cement and stone talking better  ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse  , my lord  .
it 's the smartest partition i 've ever heard speak  , my lord  .
pyramus draws near the wall  .
pyramus is coming up to the wall  .
silence  !
be quiet  !
i fear my thisbe 's promise is forgot  !
i 'm afraid my thisbe has forgotten her promise  !
and thou  , o wall  , o sweet  , o lovely wall  , that stand'st between her father 's ground and mine  .
and you  , oh wall  , oh sweet  , oh lovely wall  , you stand between her father 's property and mine  , you wall  , oh wall  , oh sweet and lovely wall  .
thou wall  , o wall  , o sweet and lovely wall  , show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne  !
show me your hole to stick my eye up against  !
thanks  , courteous wall  .
thank you  , you 're such a polite wall  .
jove shield thee well for this  !
god bless you for doing this  .
but what see i  ?
but what 's this i see  ?
no thisbe do i see  .
i do n't see any thisbe  .
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss  !
oh wicked wall  , through which i do n't see any happiness  !
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me  !
damn your stones for disappointing me like this  !
the wall  , methinks  , being sensible  , should curse again  .
since the wall is conscious  , it should curse back at him  .
flute o wall  , full often hast thou heard my moans  , for parting my fair pyramus and me  !
flute oh wall  , you 've often heard me moaning because you keep me separated from my handsome pyramus  !
my cherry lips have often kissed thy stones  , thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee  .
my cherry lips have often kissed your bricks  , which are stuck together with cement  .
i see a voice  .
i see a voice  !
now will i to the chink  , to spy an i can hear my thisbe 's face  .
i 'll go to the hole to see if i can hear my thisbe 's face  .
thisbe  ?
thisbe  ?
my love thou art  , my love  , i think  .
you are my love  , my love  , i think  .
think what thou wilt  , i am thy lover 's grace  .
i 'm your love  , no matter what you think  .
and like limander am i trusty still  .
and i 'm still faithful to you  , just like the famous  .
and i like helen  , till the fates me kill  .
and i 'll be as faithful to you as  , until the day i die  .
not shafalus to procrus was so true  .
not even shafalus was as faithful to his lover procrus as i am to you  .
as shafalus to procrus  , i to you  .
me too  , i 'm as faithful as  .
oh  , kiss me through the hole of this vile wall  !
oh  , kiss me through the hole in this nasty wall  .
i kiss the wall 's hole  , not your lips at all  .
but i 'm only kissing the wall 's hole  , not your lips at all  .
wilt thou at ninny 's tomb meet me straightway  ?
will you meet me right away at ninny 's grave  ?
tide life  , tide death  , i come without delay  .
neither death nor life will stop me from coming  .
thus have i  , wall  , my part dischargd so  .
i  , wall  , have done my part  .
and  , being done  , thus wall away doth go  .
now that i 'm done  , wall can go away  .
now is the mural down between the two neighbors  .
the lovers should 've waited around a little longer the wall between them is down now  .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard  .
this is the silliest thing i 've ever seen  .
the best in this kind are but shadows  , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them  .
the best plays are still only illusions  , and the worst are just as good  , if you just use your imagination to fill them in  .
it must be your imagination then  , and not theirs  .
in that case it 's your imagination that 's interesting  , not the play  .
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves  , they may pass for excellent men  .
if we imagine these guys as they imagine themselves  , then they 're first - class actors  .
here come two noble beasts in  , a man and a lion  .
look  , here come two noble animals  , a man and a lion  .
a very gentle beast  , of a good conscience  .
ah  , it 's a sensitive animal  , with a good conscience  .
a very best at a beast  , my lord  , that e'er i saw  .
he 's the best actor i 've ever seen play a lion  .
this lion is a very fox  , for his valor  .
he 's as brave as a fox  .
true  .
true  .
and a goose for his discretion  .
and as wise as a goose  .
not so  , my lord  .
oh  , that 's not true  , my lord  .
for his valor can not carry his discretion  , and the fox carries the goose  .
he 's not brave enough to be wise  .
his discretion  , i am sure  , can not carry his valor  , for the goose carries not the fox  .
he 's not wise enough to be brave  .
it is well  .
anyway  , he is what he is  .
leave it to his discretion  , and let us listen to the moon  .
let 's listen to the moon  .
starveling this lanthorn doth the hornd moon present
this lantern represents the
he should have worn the horns on his head  .
he should have worn the
he is no crescent  , and his horns are invisible within the circumference  .
he 's not a crescent moon  , so his horns must be invisible inside the circle  .
this lanthorn doth the hornd moon present  .
this lantern represents the moon  .
myself the man i ' th ' moon do seem to be
i myself am playing the man in the moon
this is the greatest error of all the rest  .
well then  , that 's the biggest mistake of all  .
the man should be put into the lanthorn  .
the man should be inside the lantern  .
how is it else the man i ' th ' moon  ?
how else is he the man in the moon  ?
he dares not come there for the candle  .
he ca n't go in there because of the candle  .
for you see  , it is already in snuff  .
it 's too hot  .
i am aweary of this moon  .
i 'm tired of this moon  .
would he would change  !
i wish he 'd wax or wane off the stage  .
proceed  , moon  .
go ahead  , moon  .
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon  ; i  , the man in the moon  ; this thornbush  , my thornbush  ; and this dog  , my dog  .
all i wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon  , i 'm the man in the moon  , this thornbush is my thornbush  , and this dog is my dog  .
this is old ninny 's tomb  .
this is old ninny 's tomb  .
where is my love  ?
but where is my love  ?
oh  !
hey  !
well roared  , lion  !
good roaring  , lion  !
well run  , thisbe  !
good running  , thisbe  !
well shone  , moon  !
good shining  , moon  !
truly  , the moon shines with a good grace  .
really  , the moon shines very well  .
and then came pyramus  .
and then pyramus showed up  .
and so the lion vanished  .
so the lion disappeared  .
sweet moon  , i thank thee for thy sunny beams  .
sweet moon  , i thank you for your sunny beams  .
i thank thee  , moon  , for shining now so bright  .
i thank you  , moon  , for shining now so bright  , because by the light of your gracious  , golden  , glittering gleams  , i hope to be able to see my faithful thisbe  .
for by thy gracious  , golden  , glittering gleams  , i trust to take of truest thisbe sight  .
but wait  .
but stay  , o spite  !
oh no  !
but mark  , poor knight  , what dreadful dole is here  !
but  , look  , poor me  , what a terrible tragedy is here  !
eyes  , do you see  ?
eyes  , do you see  ?
how can it be  ?
how can it be  ?
o dainty duck  !
oh  , dainty duck  !
o dear  !
oh  , dear  !
thy mantle good  , what  , stained with blood  ?
your cloak so good  , what  , stained with blood  ?
approach  , ye furies fell  !
come  , terrible furies  , and punish whoever has hurt her  !
o fates  , come  , come  , cut thread and thrum  .
oh  , fate  , come and cut the thread of my life  .
quail  , crush  , conclude  , and quell  !
conquer  , crush  , conclude  , and kill  !
this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad  .
you could get sad watching this actor 's passionate lament if one of your good friends happened to die right at the same time  .
beshrew my heart  , but i pity the man  .
damned if i do n't feel sorry for him  .
o wherefore  , nature  , didst thou lions frame  ?
oh  , mother nature  , why did you create lions  ?
since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear  , which is no  , no which was the fairest dame that lived  , that loved  , that liked  , that looked with cheer  .
a mean and awful lion has my darling  , who is no  , no  , who was the most beautiful lady who ever lived  , or loved  , or liked  , or looked  .
come  , tears  , confound  !
come on  , tears  , pour over me  !
out  , sword  , and wound  !
come on out  , sword  , and wound pyramus in the chest yes  , right here on the left side where his heart is  .
the pap of pyramus
pyramus
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass  .
with a doctor 's help he might recover and become an ass again  .
how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover  ?
if moonshine 's gone before thisbe comes back  , how will she be able to see in the dark to find her lover dead  ?
methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus  .
i do n't think a ridiculous pyramus like that one deserves much moaning  .
i hope she will be brief  .
i hope she keeps it short  .
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes  .
look  , she 's spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers  .
and thus she means  , videlicet
and now she 'll start moaning  , of course
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead  .
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead  .
ay  , and wall too  .
yes  , and wall too  .
no  , assure you  .
no  , i assure you  .
the wall is down that parted their fathers  .
the wall that kept their fathers apart has been taken down  .
will it please you to see the epilogue  , or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company  ?
would you like to see the epilogue or hear a country dance between two of us  ?
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve  .
the clock has chimed midnight  .
lovers  , to bed  .
lovers  , it 's time to go to bed  .
't is almost fairy time  .
it 's almost fairy time  .
i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatched  .
i 'm afraid we 're going to oversleep in the morning as late as we 've stayed up tonight .
this palpable - gross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night  .
this blatantly stupid play helped us kill the time until bed  .
sweet friends  , to bed  .
dear friends  , let 's go to bed  .
a fortnight hold we this solemnity  , in nightly revels and new jollity  .
we 'll continue this celebration for two weeks  , with nightly parties and new fun  .
and we fairies  , that do run by the triple hecate 's team from the presence of the sun  , following darkness like a dream  , now are frolic  .
and we fairies  , who run away from the sun just like the goddess of the night  , following darkness like a dream  , are getting antsy  .
not a mouse shall disturb this hallowed house  .
but i 'm here to make sure that not even a mouse disturbs this blessed house  .
i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door  .
i 've been sent to clean house a bit before the fairies come  .
first  , rehearse your song by rote  , to each word a warbling note  .
first rehearse your song from memory  , and make sure each note is pretty  .
hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place  .
we 'll all join hands and sing  , and bless this place with our fairy grace  .
if we shadows have offended  , think but this  , and all is mended that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear  .
if we actors have offended you  , just think of it this way and everything will be all right you were asleep when you saw these visions  , and this silly and pathetic story was no more real than a dream  .
and this weak and idle theme  , no more yielding but a dream  , gentles  , do not reprehend  .
ladies and gentlemen  , do n't get upset with me  .
if you pardon  , we will mend  .
if you forgive us  , we 'll make everything all right  .
and  , as i am an honest puck  , if we have unearnd luck now to 'scape the serpent 's tongue  , we will make amends ere long  .
i 'm an honest puck  , and i swear that if we 're lucky enough not to get hissed at  , we 'll make it up to you soon  .
else the puck a liar call  .
if not  , then i 'm a liar  .
so good night unto you all  .
so good night to everyone  .
give me your hands if we be friends  , and robin shall restore amends  .
give me some applause  , if we 're friends  , and robin will make everything up to you  .
i learn in this letter that don pedro of aragon comes this night to messina  .
according to this letter  , pedro of aragon and his army are coming to messina tonight  .
he is very near by this  .
he must be very near by now  .
he was not three leagues off when i left him  .
when i left him  , he was less than nine miles from here  .
how many gentlemen have you lost in this action  ?
how many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought  ?
but few of any sort  , and none of name  .
not many  , and no one important  .
a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers  .
a victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely  .
i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio  .
this letter also says that don pedro has given honors to a young man from florence named claudio  .
he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it  .
he has an uncle here in messina who will be glad to hear this news  .
did he break out into tears  ?
did he start weeping  ?
in great measure  .
yes  , heavily  .
a kind overflow of kindness  .
that 's a very natural display of affection  .
there are no faces truer than those that are so washed  .
there 's no face more sincere than one washed in tears  .
how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping  !
and it 's definitely better to cry because you 're happy than laugh because you 're sad  !
i pray you  , is signor montanto returned from the wars or no  ?
please tell me  , has signior returned from battle  ?
i know none of that name  , lady  .
i do n't know anyone with that name  , ma'am  .
there was none such in the army of any sort  .
there was no signior montanto in our army  .
what is he that you ask for  , niece  ?
who are you talking about  , niece  ?
my cousin means signor benedick of padua  .
my cousin means signior benedick of padua  .
oh  , he 's returned  , and as pleasant as ever he was  .
oh  , yes  , benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever  .
he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight  , and my uncle 's fool  , reading the challenge  , subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird - bolt  .
once put up a public notice in messina challenging cupid to an archery match  .
i pray you  , how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars  ?
my uncle 's jester accepted the contest on cupid 's behalf but used toy arrows at the shooting match  .
but how many hath he killed  ?
but tell me  , how many men did he kill and eat in this battle  ?
for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing  .
i promised him i would eat anyone he killed  .
he hath done good service  , lady  , in these wars  .
signior benedick served well in the war  , my lady  .
and a good soldier too  , lady  .
he 's a good soldier too  , lady  .
you must not  , sir  , mistake my niece  .
please do n't take my niece the wrong way  , sir  .
there is a kind of merry war betwixt signor benedick and her  .
benedick and beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves  .
they never meet but there 's a skirmish of wit between them  .
whenever they meet  , there 's a little battle  .
alas  , he gets nothing by that  .
and i always win  .
in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off  , and now is the whole man governed with one  , so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm  , let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse  , for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature  .
the last time we fought  , he was so dazed by the end that he was n't much smarter than his horse  .
who is his companion now  ?
so tell me  , who is he hanging around with these days  ?
he hath every month a new sworn brother  .
every month he has a new best friend  .
is 't possible  ?
is that possible  ?
very easily possible  .
it 's entirely possible  .
he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat  ; it ever changes with the next block  .
he 's incredibly fickle his affection changes faster than the latest fashions  .
i see  , lady  , the gentleman is not in your books  .
i can see you do n't like this gentleman  .
he is most in the company of the right noble claudio  .
he spends most of his time with the good  , noble claudio  .
o lord  , he will hang upon him like a disease  !
oh god  , benedick will plague him like a disease  !
he is sooner caught than the pestilence  , and the taker runs presently mad  .
benedick is an infection that 's easy to catch but hard to get rid of and he 'll drive you crazy once you 've been infected  .
god help the noble claudio  !
god help claudio  !
if he have caught the benedick  , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured  .
if he 's caught the benedick  , he 'll lose all his money before he 's cured  .
i will hold friends with you  , lady  .
i 'm going to make sure i stay on your good side  , lady  .
do  , good friend  .
do that  , my friend  .
you will never run mad  , niece  .
you will never fall victim to benedick 's charms  , my niece  .
no  , not till a hot january  .
no  , not until we see a hot january  .
don pedro is approached  .
don pedro is here  .
good signor leonato  , are you come to meet your trouble  ?
my dear signior leonato  , hosting my whole army is such a huge burden  , but you accept it and me with open arms  .
the fashion of the world is to avoid cost  , and you encounter it  .
most people choose to avoid trouble  , but you run to it  .
you embrace your charge too willingly  .
you take up your duties too cheerfully  .
i think this is your daughter  .
hero this must be your daughter  .
her mother hath many times told me so  .
that 's what her mother always tells me  .
were you in doubt  , sir  , that you asked her  ?
did you doubt that she was your daughter  , since you had to ask her mother  ?
you have it full  , benedick  .
ah  , he got you back  , benedick  !
we may guess by this what you are  , being a man  .
leonato clearly knows your reputation with women  .
truly  , the lady fathers herself  .
seriously  , though  , the lady resembles leonato so much that there can be no doubt about who her father is  .
be happy  , lady  , for you are like an honorable father  .
congratulations  , lady  : you resemble a most honorable man  .
if signor leonato be her father  , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina  , as like him as she is  .
well  , even if he is her father  , i 'm sure she would n't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders  !
i wonder that you will still be talking  , signor benedick  .
i 'm amazed you 're still talking  , signior benedick  .
nobody marks you  .
no one 's listening to you  .
what  , my dear lady disdain  !
look  , it 's my dear lady disdain  !
are you yet living  ?
are n't you dead yet  ?
is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signor benedick  ?
how could disdain die when you 're here  ?
courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence  .
when you 're around  , even lady courtesy becomes lady disdain  .
then is courtesy a turncoat  .
that makes lady courtesy a traitor  .
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies  , only you excepted  .
all ladies love me  , except you  .
and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart  , for truly i love none  .
it 's too bad i 'm so hard - hearted  , because i really do n't love anyone  .
god keep your ladyship still in that mind  , so some gentle - man or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face  .
well  , i hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up  .
scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were  .
if he has a face like yours  , a good scratching could n't make him look any worse  .
well  , you are a rare parrot - teacher  .
listen to you  , instructing me like a parrot would  .
a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours  .
i 'd rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you  .
you always end with a jade 's trick  .
you always slip out of the argument like this  .
i know you of old  .
i know you from before  .
that is the sum of all  , leonato  .
and that 's everything  , leonato  .
signior claudio and signior benedick  , my dear friend leonato hath invited you all  .
claudio  , benedick my dear friend leonato has invited you all to stay here at messina  .
i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month  , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer  .
i told him we 'll stay for at least a month  , and he says that he hopes we 'll stay longer  .
i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart  .
i think he 's actually serious  , and not just being polite  .
if you swear  , my lord  , you shall not be forsworn  .
i am being serious  , my lord  .
don john let me bid you welcome  , my lord  .
don john i welcome you here as well  .
being reconciled to the prince your brother  , i owe you all duty  .
now that you and your brother have made friends again  , i owe you the same allegiance i owe don pedro  .
i thank you  .
thank you  .
i am not of many words  , but i thank you  .
i 'm not a man who talks a lot  , but i thank you  .
please it your grace lead on  ?
if it pleases you  , your highness  , will you lead us all inside  ?
your hand  , leonato  .
give me your hand  , leonato  .
we will go together  .
we will go in together  .
benedick  , didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato  ?
benedick  , did you notice signior leonato 's daughter  ?
i noted her not  , but i looked on her  .
i saw her  , but i did n't notice her  .
is she not a modest young lady  ?
is n't she a well - mannered young lady  ?
do you question me as an honest man should do  , for my simple true judgment  ?
do you want my true opinion  ?
or would you have me speak after my custom  , as being a professed tyrant to their sex  ?
or do you want me to criticize her like i do all women  ?
no  , i pray thee speak in sober judgment  .
no  , please  , speak seriously  .
why  , i ' faith  , methinks she 's too low for a high praise  , too brown for a fair praise  , and too little for a great praise  .
well  , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly  , too dark to be praised fairly  , and too small to be praised greatly  .
only this commendation i can afford her  , that were she other than she is  , she were unhandsome  , and being no other but as she is  , i do not like her  .
i can only say this about her  : if she looked different than she does  , she would be ugly  , and since she ca n't be anything but herself  , i do n't like her  .
thou thinkest i am in sport  .
you think i 'm kidding  .
i pray thee tell me truly how thou lik'st her  .
please tell me seriously what you think of her  .
can the world buy such a jewel  ?
would it even be possible to buy a jewel as rare and precious as hero  ?
yea  , and a case to put it into  .
yes  , and you could buy a case to put it in  , too  .
but speak you this with a sad brow  ?
but tell me  , are you speaking seriously  ?
or do you play the flouting jack  , to tell us cupid is a good hare - finder and vulcan a rare carpenter  ?
or are you just teasing  ?
come  , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song  ?
if i 'm going to sing along with you  , i need to know what key you 're singing in  .
in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on  .
i think she 's the most wonderful woman i 've ever laid eyes on  .
i can see yet without spectacles  , and i see no such matter  .
i 'm still young enough to see without glasses  , and i do n't see what you 're talking about  .
there 's her cousin  , an she were not possessed with a fury  , exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december  .
if her cousin beatrice did n't have such a nasty temper  , she 'd be so much more beautiful than hero that it would be like comparing may to december  .
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband  , have you  ?
but  , hey  , this does n't mean you 're looking to get married  , does it  ?
i would scarce trust myself  , though i had sworn the contrary  , if hero would be my wife  .
even if i had sworn never to marry  , i would n't trust myself to keep that promise if hero would marry me  .
what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato 's  ?
what secrets between you have kept you from following us to leonato 's  ?
i would your grace would constrain me to tell  .
your highness will have to force me to tell  .
i charge thee on thy allegiance  .
your loyalty to me requires you to tell me what you 've been talking about  .
you hear  , count claudio  ?
look  , claudio  , i can keep secrets like a mute  ; i want you to know that  .
i can be secret as a dumb man  , i would have you think so  , but on my allegiance mark you this  , on my allegiance don pedro he is in love  .
but i owe don pedro my allegiance look  , i to tell him don pedro claudio is in love  .
with who  ?
with whom  ?
now  , that is your grace 's part  .
that 's what you 're supposed to ask me next  , your grace  .
mark how short his answer is  : with hero  , leonato 's short daughter  .
look how short the answer is with hero  , leonato 's short daughter  .
if this were so  , so were it uttered  .
if you say so  .
if my passion change not shortly  , god forbid it should be otherwise  .
unless my feelings change very soon  , i have to admit it 's true  .
amen  , if you love her  , for the lady is very well worthy  .
it 's good if you love hero  , because she 's worthy of your love  .
you speak this to fetch me in  , my lord  .
you 're trying to trick me  , my lord  .
by my troth  , i speak my thought  .
i swear  , i 'm telling you what i honestly think  .
and  , in faith  , my lord  , i spoke mine  .
and i swear i spoke honestly to benedick i am in love with hero  .
and by my two faiths and troths  , my lord  , i spoke mine  .
and swear all up and down i spoke honestly when i said that this was a horrible idea  .
that i love her  , i feel  .
i feel that i love her  .
that she is worthy  , i know  .
i know that she is worthy of that love  .
thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty  .
you never did believe in the power of beauty  .
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will  .
or in the power of reason  .
that a woman conceived me  , i thank her  .
i was conceived by a woman  , and i thank her very much for all her effort  .
that she brought me up  , i likewise give her most humble thanks  .
and then she brought me up  , and i thank her for that  , too  .
but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick  , all women shall pardon me  .
but all the other women will have to forgive me for not being willing to be made a fool of cheated on by a wife  .
because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any  , i will do myself the right to trust none  .
i do n't want to insult any particular woman by doubting and mistrusting her  , so i 'll just avoid them all  .
and the fine is  , for the which i may go the finer  , i will live a bachelor  .
and the conclusion of this is that i 'll live as a bachelor and  , with the money i save  , dress better  .
i shall see thee  , ere i die  , look pale with love  .
i swear  , before i die i 'm going to see you sick with love  .
with anger  , with sickness  , or with hunger  , my lord  , not with love  .
with anger  , with fever  , or with hunger  , sure  , my friend  , but never sick with love  .
prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking  , pick out mine eyes with a ballad - maker 's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid  .
if you can prove that i 'll ever be so in love that i ca n't be brought to my senses with a good round of beers  , you can pluck out my eyes with a love - poet 's pen and hang me on a brothel 's door where the picture of blind cupid usually goes  .
well  , as time shall try  .
well  , time will tell  .
in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke  .
even the most savage bull is eventually domesticated  .
if this should ever happen  , thou wouldst be horn - mad  .
if that ever happened  , you 'd go absolutely mad  .
i look for an earthquake too  , then  .
that 's about as likely as an earthquake  .
well  , you temporize with the hours  .
oh  , you 'll soften as time passes  .
in the meantime  , good signior benedick  , repair to leonato 's  .
while you 're waiting for that to happen  , though  , hurry to leonato 's  .
commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper  , for indeed he hath made great preparation  .
give him my respects  , and tell him i 'll definitely be there for dinner  , since i know he has gone to great lengths for this meal  .
to the tuition of god  .
into god 's hands  .
from my house  , if i had it
from my house  , if i had a house
the sixth of july  .
the sixth of july  .
your loving friend  , benedick  .
sincerely  , your loving friend  , benedick  .
nay  , mock not  , mock not  .
oh  , stop joking around  .
the body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither  .
you know  , sometimes you two dress up your conversation with flimsy little bits of wit that do n't hold together too well  .
ere you flout old ends any further  , examine your conscience  .
before you make of everyone else  , look at yourselves in the mirror  !
and so i leave you  .
and with that  , i 'm leaving  .
my liege  , your highness now may do me good  .
my lord  , you could really help me out now  .
my love is thine to teach  .
i am at your service  .
teach it but how  , and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good  .
just tell me what you want me to do  , and however hard it is  , you 'll see that i 'm eager to do it  .
hath leonato any son  , my lord  ?
does leonato have a son  , my lord  ?
no child but hero  ; she 's his only heir  .
hero is his only child  , and his only heir  .
dost thou affect her  , claudio  ?
do you like her  , claudio  ?
he is very busy about it  .
he is taking care of it as we speak  .
but  , brother  , i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of  .
but brother  , i have some strange news for you  .
are they good  ?
is it good news  ?
hath the fellow any wit that told you this  ?
is this servant of yours a smart man  ?
a good sharp fellow  .
he 's very bright  .
i will send for him  , and question him yourself  .
i 'll get him to come here  , and you can ask him yourself  .
no  , no  , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself  .
no  , no  , until it comes true we 'll pretend it was just a dream we had  .
but i will acquaint my daughter withal  , that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true  .
but my daughter should know about this  , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case  .
go you and tell her of it  .
go to her and tell her for me  .
cousins  , you know what you have to do  .
cousins  , you all have work to do  .
o  , i cry you mercy  , friend  .
oh  , i beg your pardon  .
go you with me and i will use your skill  .
come with me now  , and help me out  .
good cousin  , have a care this busy time  .
dear cousin  , please be careful during this busy time  .
what the goodyear  , my lord  , why are you thus out of measure sad  ?
really  , my lord  , why are you so excessively sad  ?
there is no measure in the occasion that breeds  .
the things that cause my sadness are without limit  .
therefore the sadness is without limit  .
therefore my sadness is without limit  .
and when i have heard it  , what blessing brings it  ?
and after i have sat and listened to reason  , what 's my prize  ?
if not a present remedy  , at least a patient sufferance  .
if not an end to your suffering  , then at least you 'll have the means to endure it patiently  .
can you make no use of your discontent  ?
ca n't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage  ?
i make all use of it  , for i use it only  .
i use it all the time  , since it 's all that i have  .
who comes here  ?
who 's that  ?
what news  , borachio  ?
what 's going on  , borachio  ?
i came yonder from a great supper  .
i just came from a great feast where leonato is entertaining the prince  , your brother  .
the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato  , and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage  .
i can give you information about an intended marriage  .
will it serve for any model to build mischief on  ?
will this give me an opportunity to make some mischief  ?
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness  ?
who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage  ?
marry  , it is your brother 's right hand  .
your brother 's right - hand man  .
who  ?
who  ?
the most exquisite claudio  ?
that pretty boy  , claudio  ?
even he  .
that 's the one  .
marry  , on hero  , the daughter and heir of leonato  .
hero  , the daughter and heir of leonato  .
a very forward march - chick  !
a lively young one  !
how came you to this  ?
how did you learn about this  ?
come  , come  , let us thither  .
come  , let 's go to the dance  .
this may prove food to my displeasure  .
this just may cheer me up  .
that young start - up hath all the glory of my overthrow  .
claudio  , the young upstart  , was responsible for keeping me from gaining power over my brother  .
if i can cross him any way  , i bless myself every way  .
if there 's any way i can spoil his life  , i 'll be overjoyed  .
you are both sure  , and will assist me  ?
you 'll both help me  , right  ?
to the death  , my lord  .
until the day we die  , my lord  .
let us to the great supper  .
let 's go to this great feast  .
their cheer is the greater that i am subdued  .
they 'll be even happier now that my mood has lightened  .
would the cook were o ' my mind  !
it 's too bad the cook does n't think like me  ; she would have poisoned them all if she did  .
shall we go prove what 's to be done  ?
should we go check out the scene  ?
we 'll wait upon your lordship  .
lead the way  , sir  .
was not count john here at supper  ?
was n't don john at dinner tonight  ?
i saw him not  .
i did n't see him  .
how tartly that gentleman looks  !
that man always looks so sour  !
i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after  .
just looking at him gives me heartburn  .
he is of a very melancholy disposition  .
he has a very gloomy attitude  .
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick  .
it would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between don john and benedick  .
the one is too like an image and says nothing  , and the other too like my lady 's eldest son  , evermore tattling  .
one of them is too much like a painting of a man he never speaks and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy  , always chattering  .
then half signor benedick 's tongue in count john 's mouth  , and half count john 's melancholy in signor benedick 's face
so  , the man would talk half as much as benedick and be half as serious as don john
with a good leg and a good foot  , uncle  , and money enough in his purse  , such a man would win any woman in the world  , if he could get her goodwill  .
and if he were handsome  , agile  , and rich  , too  , he could have any woman in the world all he 'd need was her good will  .
by my troth  , niece  , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue  .
really  , niece  , you 'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people  .
in faith  , she 's too curst  .
honestly  , she is too ill - tempered  .
so  , by being too curst  , god will send you no horns  .
so then  , for being too argumentative  , god wo n't send you any horns  ?
you may light on a husband that hath no beard  .
maybe you will find a husband without a beard  .
well then  , go you into hell  ?
so you 'll go to hell  ?
hero well  , niece  , i trust you will be ruled by your father  .
hero well  , niece  , i trust that you will defer to your father on these important decisions  .
yes  , faith  , it is my cousin 's duty to make curtsy and say  , father  , as it please you  .
surely  , my cousin has a duty to please her father  .
but yet for all that  , cousin  , let him be a handsome fellow  , or else make another curtsy and say  , father  , as it please me  .
but if the husband her father chooses is n't handsome  , she should sweetly tell her father that she will please herself with another one  .
well  , niece  , i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband  .
well  , niece  , i hope that i will see you married one day  .
not till god make men of some other metal than earth  .
no  , i wo n't take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt  .
would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust  ?
what woman would n't be distressed  , being lorded over by a handful of dust  ?
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl  ?
can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay  ?
no  , uncle  , i 'll none  .
no  , uncle  , i wo n't be married  .
adam 's sons are my brethren  , and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred  .
and anyhow  , if is the father of all mankind  , then his sons are my brothers  , and really i believe that incest is a sin  .
hero daughter  , remember what i told you  .
hero daughter  , remember what i told you  .
if the prince do solicit you in that kind  , you know your answer  .
if the prince asks for your hand in marriage  , you know what to tell him  .
cousin  , you apprehend passing shrewdly  .
niece  , you are exceptionally perceptive  .
i have a good eye  , uncle  .
i have a good eye  , uncle  .
i can see a church by daylight  .
i can see what 's in broad daylight  .
the revelers are entering  , brother  .
the partygoers have arrived  .
make good room  .
let 's give them room  .
lady  , will you walk a bout with your friend  ?
my lady  , will you have a dance with me  ?
with me in your company  ?
will i be with you then  ?
i may say so when i please  .
perhaps  , if i decide to let you  .
and when please you to say so  ?
and when will that be  ?
when i like your favor  , for god defend the lute should be like the case  !
when i like the way you look  , for god forbid your face be as ugly as your mask  !
my visor is philemon 's roof  ; within the house is jove  .
my mask is like the roof of the poor humble cottage  ; underneath the mask  , i am as magnificent as the glorious god jove  .
why  , then  , your visor should be thatched  .
well  , then  , since philemon 's roof was thatched with straw  , your mask should have a beard  .
speak low if you speak love  .
if you wish to speak of love  , speak more softly  .
well  , i would you did like me  .
well  , i wish you liked me  .
which is one  ?
tell me one  .
i say my prayers aloud  .
i say my prayers out loud  .
god match me with a good dancer  !
god give me a good dance partner  !
and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done  !
and god take him away from me when we 're finished dancing  !

i know you by the waggling of your head  .
i can tell by the way you waggle your head  .
to tell you true  , i counterfeit him  .
really  , i 'm only pretending to be him  .
you could never do him so ill - well unless you were the very man  .
you could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself  .
here 's his dry hand up and down  .
look  , you 've got his wrinkled hands  .
you are he  , you are he  .
you are antonio  , you are he  .

in short  , i 'm not  .
come  , come  , do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit  ?
come on  , do you think i ca n't recognize you by your excellent wit  ?
can virtue hide itself  ?
can a good thing hide itself  ?
go to  , mum  , you are he  .
be quiet  , you are antonio  .
graces will appear  , and there 's an end  .
a man 's virtues will always show themselves  , and that 's the end of that  .

nay  , if they lead to any ill  , i will leave them at the next turning  .
no  , if they try to lead us to harm  , i will leave the dance floor at the next song  .

you sound like a cattle dealer  : that 's the way they sell bulls  .
but did you think the prince would have served you thus  ?
but do you really think the prince would treat you that way  ?

what 's his fault  ?
why  , what did he do  ?
the flat transgression of a schoolboy who  , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest  , shows it his companion  , and he steals it  .
he was like a schoolboy who finds a bird 's nest and happily shows it to his friend  , who then steals it from him  .
wilt thou make a trust a transgression  ?
what  , is trusting a friend such a crime  ?
the transgression is in the stealer  .
the criminal is the one who stole the nest  .
i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner  .

i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia  , bring you the length of prester john 's foot  , fetch you a hair off the great cham 's beard  , do you any embassage to the pygmies  , rather than hold three words ' conference with this harpy  .

why  , you 're absolutely right  , cousin  .
good lord for alliance  !

proof enough to misuse the prince  , to vex claudio  , to undo hero  , and kill leonato  .

o  , good my lord  , tax not so bad a voice to slander music anymore than once  .
oh  , my good lord  , do n't make me insult music again with my awful singing  .
it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection  .
you can tell an artist is excellent when he denies his own perfection  .
i pray thee  , sing  , and let me woo no more  .
please  , sing for us  ; do n't make me woo you anymore  !
note this before my notes  : there 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting  .

note notes  , forsooth  , and nothing  .
get on with your note - playing now  .
by my troth  , a good song  .
that 's a good song  .
and an ill singer  , my lord  .
and a bad singer  , my lord  .

come hither  , leonato  .

what was it you told me of today  , that your niece beatrice was in love with signor benedick  ?
what was it that you told me today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick  ?
oh  , ay  .
oh yes  .
don pedro stalk on  , stalk on  ; the fowl sits  .
don pedro go on  , keep walking  : our prey is in sight  .
i did never think that lady would have loved any man  .
i never thought that woman would love any man  .
is 't possible  ?
is it possible  ?
sits the wind in that corner  ?
is that the way the wind is blowing  ?
by my troth  , my lord  , i can not tell what to think of it  , but that she loves him with an enraged affection  , it is past the infinite of thought  .
really  , my lord  , i do n't know what to make of it  , but she loves him with such a passion that it 's past all understanding  .
may be she doth but counterfeit  .
maybe she 's just pretending  .
faith  , like enough  .
yes  , that 's quite likely  .
o god  !
oh god  !
counterfeit  ?
pretending  ?
there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it  .
no one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this  , then  .
why  , what effects of passion shows she  ?
why  , what symptoms of love does she exhibit  ?
leonato bait the hook well  ; this fish will bite  .
leonato bait the hook well  ; this fish is going to bite  .
what effects  , my lord  ?
what symptoms  , my lord  ?
she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how  .
she will have a seat you heard my daughter tell you how  .
she did indeed  .
yes  , she did tell us  .
how  , how i pray you  ?
please  , please tell me  !
you amaze me  .
this is amazing  .
i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection  .
i would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love  .
i would have sworn it had  , my lord  , especially against benedick  .
i would have sworn that  , too  , my lord  , especially against benedick  .
i should think this a gull but that the white - bearded fellow speaks it  .
i would take this as a joke if the old man were n't saying it  .
knavery can not  , sure  , hide himself in such reverence  .
mischief surely ca n't be hiding in such a respectable man  .
don pedro he hath ta'en th ' infection  .
don pedro we 've infected him  !
hold it up  .
keep it up  .
hath she made her affection known to benedick  ?
has she told benedick how she feels  ?
no  , and swears she never will  .
no  , and she swears she never will  .
that 's her torment  .
that 's what 's driving her crazy  .
't is true indeed  , so your daughter says  .
it 's true  , hero says so  .
shall i  , says she  , that have so oft encountered him with scorn  , write to him that i love him  ?
beatrice asks  , does it make any sense to write and tell him i love him when i have always treated him with scorn  ?
now you talk of a sheet of paper  , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told  .
now that you speak of paper  , i remember a funny story of hero 's  .
oh  , when she had writ it and was reading it over  , she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet  ?
oh  , you mean when beatrice writes a letter and hero sees that it has benedick and beatrice written all over it  ?
that  .
yes  , that 's the one  .
then down upon her knees she falls  , weeps  , sobs  , beats her heart  , tears her hair  , prays  , curses  : o sweet benedick  !
then she falls down to her knees  , weeps  , sobs  , beats her breast  , tears her hair  , prays  , and curses  : oh sweet benedick  !
god give me patience  !
god give me patience  !
it were good that benedick knew of it by some other  , if she will not discover it  .
if she wo n't tell benedick  , someone else should  .
to what end  ?
and what would that accomplish  ?
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse  .
he 'll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more  .
an he should  , it were an alms to hang him  .
if he did that  , it would be a charitable deed to hang him  .
she 's an excellent sweet lady  , and  , out of all suspicion  , she is virtuous  .
she 's an excellent  , sweet woman  , and there 's no doubt that she is virtuous  .
and she is exceeding wise  .
and she is very smart  .
in every thing but in loving benedick  .
except for the fact that she loves benedick  .
oh  , my lord  , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body  , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory  .
oh  , my lord  , when wisdom and passion are in one body  , it 's ten to one that the passion will win  .
i am sorry for her  , as i have just cause  , being her uncle and her guardian  .
i am sorry for her  , as i should be  , since i am both her uncle and her guardian  .
i would she had bestowed this dotage on me  .
i wish she were in love with me instead  .
i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself  .
i would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife  .
i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say  .
please  , tell benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say  .
were it good  , think you  ?
is that a good idea  , do you think  ?
hero thinks surely she will die  , for she says she will die if he love her not  , and she will die ere she make her love known  , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness  .
hero thinks beatrice will surely die  , for she says she 'll die if he does n't love her  , and that she 'll die before she tells him  , and she 'll die if he woos her and she 's made to hold back even one of her usual insults  .
she doth well  .
she 's probably right  .
if she should make tender of her love  , 't is very possible he 'll scorn it  , for the man  , as you know all  , hath a contemptible spirit  .
if she offers him her love  , it 's very possible that he 'll scorn it  , since  , as we all know  , he tends to be contemptuous  .
he is a very proper man  .
he 's a very proper man  .
he hath indeed a good outward happiness  .
indeed  , he is good - looking and carries himself well  .
before god  , and in my mind  , very wise  .
and i swear to god he 's very smart  .
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit  .
he does indeed show sparks of something like wit  .
and i take him to be valiant  .
and i believe him to be brave  .
if he do fear god  , he must necessarily keep peace  .
if he fears god  , he must necessarily keep the peace  .
if he break the peace  , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling  .
if he breaks the peace  , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling  .
and so will he do  , for the man doth fear god  , howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make  .
and he 'll do that  , because he 's a god - fearing man  , even though his joking makes it seem otherwise  .
well  , i am sorry for your niece  .
well  , i 'm sorry for your niece  .
shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love  ?
should we go find benedick and tell him about beatrice 's love  ?
nay  , that 's impossible  .
no  , that 's impossible  .
she may wear her heart out first  .
her heart will break first  .
well  , we will hear further of it by your daughter  .
well  , we 'll hear more about it from your daughter  .
let it cool the while  .
let it sit for a while  .
i love benedick well  , and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady  .
i am very fond of benedick  , and i just wish he would take a look at himself and realize how unfairly he 's treating this good woman  .
my lord  , will you walk  ?
my lord  , will you come with me  ?
dinner is ready  .
dinner is ready  .
don pedro leonato if he do not dote on her upon this  , i will never trust my expectation  .
don pedro leonato if he does n't fall in love with her now  , i 'll never trust my intuition again  .
leonato let there be the same net spread for her  , and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry  .
leonato the same trap must be set for her  ; that 's your daughter 's and servants ' job  .
the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another 's dotage  , and no such matter  .
the real fun will be when they both believe the other to be in love  , without any of it being true  .
that 's the scene that i would see  , which will be merely a dumb show  .
i ca n't wait to watch that drama it 'll be a pantomime  , since both of them will be totally speechless  !
let us send her to call him in to dinner  .
let 's send beatrice to call benedick in to dinner
against my will  , i am sent to bid you come in to dinner  .
against my will  , i 've been told to bring you in to dinner  .
fair beatrice  , i thank you for your pains  .
lovely beatrice  , i thank you for taking the pains to tell me that  .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me  .
i did n't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me  .
if it had been painful  , i would not have come  .
if the job had been painful  , i would not have come  .
you take pleasure then in the message  ?
so you took pleasure in bringing me this message  ?
yea  , just so much as you may take upon a knife 's point and choke a daw withal  .
yes  , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint  .
you have no stomach  , signior  .
you do n't want to eat  , sir  ?
fare you well  .
goodbye  , then  .
ha  !
ha  !
against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner  .
against my will  , i 've been told to bring you in to dinner  .
there 's a double meaning in that  .
there 's a double meaning in that  .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me  .
i did n't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me  .
that 's as much as to say  , any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks  .
that 's like saying  , any thing i do for you is as easy as saying thank you  . '
if i do not take pity of her  , i am a villain  .
if this does n't move me to take pity on her  , i 'm a horrible person  .
if i do not love her  , i am a jew  .
if i do n't love her  , i 'm completely  .
i will go get her picture  .
i will go get her picture  .
i 'll make her come  , i warrant you  , presently  .
i 'll make her come right away  , i promise you  .
now  , ursula  , when beatrice doth come  , as we do trace this alley up and down  , our talk must only be of benedick  .
all right ursula  , as beatrice arrives  , we 'll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but benedick  .
when i do name him  , let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit  .
whenever i mention him  , praise him more than any man deserves  .
my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice  .
it 'll be my job to talk about how benedick is sick with love for beatrice  .
of this matter is little cupid 's crafty arrow made  , that only wounds by hearsay  .
we 'll make our arrows the same way cupid does  : with gossip and rumor  .
hero the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait  .
hero the best part of fishing is watching the fish cut through the water and greedily take the bait  .
so angle we for beatrice  , who even now is couchd in the woodbine coverture  .
now we 're fishing for beatrice  , who 's hiding right now in the honeysuckle arbor  .
fear you not my part of the dialogue  .
do n't worry  , i 'll do my part  .
ursula then go we near her  , that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it  .
ursula then let 's get closer  , so she can hear all the false  , sweet bait we 're setting for her  .
no  , truly  , ursula  , she is too disdainful  .
no  , truly  , ursula  , she 's too scornful  .
i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock  .
she 's as devious and fierce as the wild hawks on the rocks  .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely  ?
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice that much  ?
so says the prince and my new - trothd lord  .
that 's what the prince and my fianc say  .
and did they bid you tell her of it  , madam  ?
and did they ask you to tell beatrice about this  , madam  ?
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it  , but i persuaded them  , if they loved benedick  , to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it  .
they did want me to tell her  , but i persuaded them that  , if they truly loved benedick  , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep beatrice in the dark  .
why did you so  ?
why did you do that  ?
doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon  ?
does n't benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with beatrice  ?
sure  , sure  , such carping is not commendable  .
it 's true  , her nitpicking is hardly admirable  .
no  , not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is  , can not be commendable  .
no  , it certainly is not admirable to be so perverse and eccentric  .
but who dare tell her so  ?
but who would dare tell her  ?
if i should speak  , she would mock me into air  .
if i said something  , she 'd mock me so mercilessly that i 'd probably disintegrate into air  .
o  , she would laugh me out of myself  , press me to death with wit  .
she 'd laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit  .
o  , do not do your cousin such a wrong  !
oh  , do n't injure your cousin like that  !
she can not be so much without true judgment  , having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have  , as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick  .
with the quick  , intelligent wit she 's rumored to have  , she ca n't really be such a bad judge of character that she 'd refuse a man as exceptional as signior benedick  .
he is the only man of italy  , always excepted my dear claudio  .
he 's the only worthy man in italy  , aside from my dear claudio  .
indeed  , he hath an excellent good name  .
true  , he has an excellent reputation  .
his excellence did earn it  , ere he had it  .
and he deserves it  , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it  .
when are you married  , madam  ?
when are you getting married  , madam  ?
why  , every day  , tomorrow  .
tomorrow  , and then every day after that  .
come  , go in  .
come on  , let 's go inside  .
i 'll show thee some attires  , and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow  .
i want to show you some clothing  , so you can tell me what i should wear tomorrow  .
what fire is in mine ears  ?
i 'm burning up with shame  !
can this be true  ?
can this be true  ?
stand i condemned for pride and scorn so much  ?
do people criticize me this much for being proud and scornful  ?
contempt  , farewell  , and maiden pride  , adieu  !
then i 'll say goodbye to my contempt and my pride in being unmarried  !
no glory lives behind the back of such  .
no good is spoken of such a person as me behind her back  .
and benedick  , love on  ; i will requite thee  , taming my wild heart to thy loving hand  .
benedick  , keep on loving me and i will return your love  , like a wild hawk being tamed by her handler  .
if thou dost love  , my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band  .
i 'll be kind to you from now on  , and if you really do love me  , that kindness will encourage you to seal our love with a wedding band  .
for others say thou dost deserve  , and i believe it better than reportingly  .
people say that you deserve my love  , and i believe it not just because they 've said so  .
i do but stay till your marriage be consummate  , and then go i toward aragon  .
i 'll stay in messina until you 're married  , and then i 'll go to aragon  .
i 'll bring you thither  , my lord  , if you 'll vouchsafe me  .
i 'll go with you  , my lord  , if you 'll allow me  .
nay  , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it  .
no  , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it  .
i will only be bold with benedick for his company  , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth  .
i 'll ask only benedick to come with me  , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he 's a joker  .
he hath twice or thrice cut cupid 's bow - string  , and the little hangman dare not shoot at him  .
he 's evaded love once or twice  , and since then cupid does n't dare to shoot at him  .
he hath a heart as sound as a bell  , and his tongue is the clapper  , for what his heart thinks  , his tongue speaks  .
benedick 's heart is like a bell  , with his tongue as the clapper  : everything his heart thinks  , his tongue speaks  .
gallants  , i am not as i have been  .
gentleman  , i am not the same man i was before  .
so say i .
i agree  .
methinks you are sadder  .
i think you seem more serious  .
i hope he be in love  .
i hope he 's in love  .
hang him  , truant  !
come off it  , man  !
there 's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love  .
there is n't a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love  .
if he be sad  , he wants money  .
if he looks serious  , he must need money  .
i have the toothache  .
i have a  .
what  , sigh for the toothache  ?
what  , are you moaning on about your toothache  ?
where is but a humor or a worm  .
it could only have been caused by some humor or  .
well  , everyone can master a grief but he that has it  .
well  , everyone knows how to overcome an injury except the one who actually has one  .
yet say i  , he is in love  .
i repeat  , he 's in love  .
if he be not in love with some woman  , there is no believing old signs  .
if he 's not in love with a woman  , then you ca n't trust the usual symptoms  .
he brushes his hat o ' mornings  .
he brushes his hat in the mornings  .
what should that bode  ?
what do you think that means  ?
hath any man seen him at the barber 's  ?
has any man seen him at the barber 's  ?
indeed  , he looks younger than he did  , by the loss of a beard  .
getting rid of the beard definitely makes him look younger  .
nay  , he rubs himself with civet  .
and he 's rubbed himself with perfume  .
can you smell him out by that  ?
can you smell out his secret now  ?
that 's as much as to say  , the sweet youth 's in love  .
that 's as good as proof that the sweet young man 's in love  .
the greatest note of it is his melancholy  .
the biggest clue is his seriousness  .
and when was he wont to wash his face  ?
and when has he ever been known to wash his face  ?
yea  , or to paint himself  ?
yes  , or to wear cosmetics  ?
for the which i hear what they say of him  .
i hear what they say about him for doing that  .
nay  , but his jesting spirit  , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops
indeed  , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  , and he can be played like an instrument
indeed  , that tells a heavy tale for him  .
truly  , it all adds up to a serious story for benedick  .
conclude  , conclude  , he is in love  .
a conclusion  , a conclusion  : he is in love  .
nay  , but i know who loves him  .
oh  , and i know who loves him  .
yes  , and his ill conditions  , and  , in despite of all  , dies for him  .
no  , she does know him  , and she also knows all his bad qualities and in spite of all this  , she still dies for him  .
she shall be buried with her face upwards  .
she 'll be buried with her face upwards  , then  .
yet is this no charm for the toothache  .
this chatter is no cure for my toothache  .
old signior  , walk aside with me  .
leonato old sir  , please walk with me a bit  .
i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you  , which these hobbyhorses must not hear  .
i have eight or nine well - considered words to say to you  , and i do n't want these fools to hear  .
for my life  , to break with him about beatrice  !
i bet my life he 's gone to speak with leonato about beatrice  !
my lord and brother  , god save you  .
my lord and brother  , god save you  .
good e'en  , brother  .
good evening  , brother  .
if your leisure served  , i would speak with you  .
if you do n't mind  , i 'd like to speak with you  .
in private  ?
in private  ?
if it please you  .
if you wish  .
yet count claudio may hear  , for what i would speak of concerns him  .
but count claudio can stay  , for what i 'm about to say concerns him  .
what 's the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
claudio means your lordship to be married tomorrow  ?
claudio do you plan on getting married tomorrow  ?
you know he does  .
you know that he does  .
i know not that  , when he knows what i know  .
i do n't know that  , once he knows what i know  .
if there be any impediment  , i pray you discover it  .
if there 's any reason we should n't get married  , i urge you to tell me  .
you may think i love you not  .
you may think that i do n't love you  .
let that appear hereafter  , and aim better at me by that i now will manifest  .
i hope that  , after i tell you my news  , you will think better of me  .
for my brother  , i think he holds you well  , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed  .
my brother thinks highly of you  , and because of his affection  , has helped arrange your marriage but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy  .
why  , what 's the matter  ?
why  , what 's the matter  ?
i came hither to tell you  ; and  , circumstances shortened  , for she has been too long a - talking of  , the lady is disloyal  .
i came here to tell you i 'll make this short  , since she 's already been talked about for too long the lady is unfaithful  .
who  , hero  ?
who  , hero  ?
even she  : leonato 's hero  , your hero  , every man 's hero  .
that 's the one  : leonato 's hero  , your hero  , every man 's hero  .
disloyal  ?
unfaithful  ?
the word is too good to paint out her wickedness  .
the word is too good to represent her wickedness  .
i could say she were worse  .
she is worse than wicked  .
think you of a worse title  , and i will fit her to it  .
if you can think of a more awful title  , i 'll call her that  .
wonder not till further warrant  .
but do n't keep wondering without more proof  .
go but with me tonight  , you shall see her chamber window entered  , even the night before her wedding day  .
come with me tonight  , and you 'll see a man enter her bedroom chamber even tonight  , the night before her wedding  .
if you love her then  , tomorrow wed her  .
if you still love her after that  , then marry her tomorrow  .
but it would better fit your honor to change your mind  .
but you would be more honorable if you changed your mind  .
don pedro may this be so  ?
don pedro is this possible  ?
i will not think it  .
i wo n't consider it  .
if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her  , tomorrow in the congregation  , where i should wed  , there will i shame her  .
if i see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her  , i 'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where i would have married her  .
and as i wooed for thee to obtain her  , i will join with thee to disgrace her  .
and since i wooed her in your name  , i 'll join you in disgracing her  .
i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses  .
i wo n't say anything else about her until you two see things for yourselves  .
bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself  .
remain calm until midnight  , and then you 'll see what the trouble is  .
o day untowardly turned  !
oh  , this day has turned into a disaster  !
o mischief strangely thwarting  !
oh  , mischief has ruined our plans  !
o plague right well prevented  !
oh  , a plague has been prevented  , thank god  !
so will you say when you have seen the sequel  .
that 's what you 'll say once you 've seen part two  .
are you good men and true  ?
are you all good and honest men  ?
yea  , or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation  , body and soul  .
yes they are  , otherwise it would be proper for them to suffer  , body and soul  .
nay  , that were a punishment too good for them  , if they should have any allegiance in them  , being chosen for the prince 's watch  .
if they had any when they were chosen for the prince 's watch  , a punishment like that would be too good for them  .
well  , give them their charge  , neighbor dogberry  .
well  , give them their assignment  , sir dogberry  .
first  , who think you the most desartless man to be constable  ?
first  , which man do you think is most to be leader of the watch  ?
hugh otecake  , sir  , or george seacole  , for they can write and read  .
either hugh otecake  , sir  , or else george seacole  , because both of them can read and write  .
come hither  , neighbor seacole  .
come here  , sir seacole  .
god hath blessed you with a good name  .
god has blessed you with a good name  .
to be a well - favored man is the gift of fortune  , but to write and read comes by nature  .
to be good - looking is a matter of luck  , but to read and write is a natural gift  .
both which  , master constable
both of which  , master constable
how if he will not stand  ?
and what if he wo n't stop  ?
if he will not stand when he is bidden  , he is none of the prince 's subjects  .
if he wo n't stop when he 's told to  , then he is n't one of the prince 's subjects  .
true  , and they are to meddle with none but the prince 's subjects  .
true  , and you are n't supposed to meddle with anyone but the prince 's subjects  .
you shall also make no noise in the streets  ; for  , for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured  .
you will also stay quiet in the streets  , for a babbling watch is most and will not be endured  .
we will rather sleep than talk  .
we 'll sleep instead of talk  .
we know what belongs to a watch  .
we know what 's appropriate for a watch  .
why  , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman  , for i can not see how sleeping should offend  .
why  , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman  .
only have a care that your bills be not stolen  .
sleeping on the watch should n't be a problem  ; just make sure that your weapons do n't get stolen  .
well  , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed  .
also  , you 're supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who 's drunk to go home and go to bed  .
how if they will not  ?
and what if they wo n't go  ?
why  , then  , let them alone till they are sober  .
well then  , leave them alone until they 're sober  .
if they make you not then the better answer  , you may say they are not the men you took them for  .
if even then they do n't answer to your satisfaction  , you can say that they 're not the men you thought they were  .
well  , sir  .
very good  , sir  .
if we know him to be a thief  , shall we not lay hands on him  ?
so if we know that a man is a thief  , should we try to arrest him  ?
truly  , by your office you may  , but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled  .
your position permits you to  , but i think that those who stick their hands in get their hands dirty  .
the most peaceable way for you  , if you do take a thief  , is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company  .
if you encounter a thief  , i think the most peaceable thing to do is to let him be himself and steal away  .
you have been always called a merciful man  , partner  .
you have always been known as a merciful man  , partner  .
truly  , i would not hang a dog by my will  , much more a man who hath any honesty in him  .
truly  , i would n't even hang a dog  , much a man who has any honesty in him  .
if you hear a child cry in the night  , you must call to the nurse and bid her still it  .
if you hear a child crying in the night  , you should call the nurse and tell her to quiet the child  .
how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us  ?
what if the nurse is asleep and does n't hear us  ?
't is very true  .
that 's very true  .
this is the end of the charge  .
and that 's the end of your assignment  .
you  , constable  , are to present the prince 's own person  .
you  , constable  , are representing the prince himself  .
if you meet the prince in the night  , you may stay him  .
if you meet the prince in the night  , you can order him to stop  .
nay  , by 'r lady  , that i think he can not  .
no  , by our lady  , i do n't think he can  .
by 'r lady  , i think it be so  .
by our lady  , i think that 's true  .
well  , masters  , we hear our charge  .
well gentlemen  , we 've heard our assignment  .
let us go sit here upon the church bench till two  , and then all to bed  .

conrade  , i say  !
conrade  , i say  !
mass  , and my elbow itched  , i thought there would a scab follow  .
come to think of it  , i thought i felt a scab there  .
i will owe thee an answer for that  .
i 'll get you for that  .
and now forward with thy tale  .
now get on with your story  .
stand thee close  , then  , under this penthouse  , for it drizzles rain  , and i will  , like a true drunkard  , utter all to thee  .
since it 's drizzling  , stand under this overhang with me and  , like a true drunk  , i 'll tell you everything  .
some treason  , masters  .
watchmen there 's some treason occurring  , gentlemen  .
yet stand close  .
stay here  .
therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats  .
you should know i 've earned a thousand gold pieces from don john  .
is it possible that any villainy should be so dear  ?
is it possible that any crime could be so valuable  ?
thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich  .
you should ask instead if it 's possible that any criminal could be so rich  .
for when rich villains have need of poor ones  , poor ones may make what price they will  .
because when rich villains need poor villains ' services  , those poor ones can name the price  .
i wonder at it  .
i ca n't believe it  .
that shows thou art unconfirmed  .
that only proves how inexperienced you are  .
thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet  , or a hat  , or a cloak  , is nothing to a man  .
you know that the style of a man 's jacket or hat or coat means nothing  .
yes  , it is apparel  .
yes  , it 's just clothing  .
i mean the fashion  .
no  , i mean  , the fashion of a man 's clothing tells us nothing about the man  .
yes  , the fashion is the fashion  .
yes  , fashion is fashion  .
tush  , i may as well say the fool 's the fool  .
c'mon  , i might as well say the fool 's the fool  !
but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is  ?
but do n't you see what a villain fashion is  ?
i know that deformed  .
watchmen i know that man  ,  .
he has been a vile thief this seven year  .
for the past seven years  , he 's been a wicked thief  .
he goes up and down like a gentleman  .

her blush is guiltiness  , not modesty  .
she blushes from guilt  , not modesty  .
what do you mean  , my lord  ?
what do you mean  , my lord  ?
dear my lord  , if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity

oh  , but now you have fallen into a pit of ink  , and there 's not enough water in the whole wide sea to wash you clean again  , and not enough salt to cover your stink  .
sir  , sir  , be patient  .
sir  , sir  , calm down  .
for my part  , i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say  .

trust not my reading nor my observations  , which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book  ; trust not my age  , my reverence  , calling  , nor divinity  , if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error  .
you can doubt all these things if this sweet lady turns out to be guilty  .
lady  , what man is he you are accused of  ?
lady  , who do they accuse you of having taken as your lover  ?
they know that do accuse me  .
you should ask them  .
i know none  .
i do n't know who they 're talking about  .
if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant  , let all my sins lack mercy  !
if i 've been with a man in any improper way  , let all my sins be punished  !
o my father  , prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet  , or that i yesternight maintained the change of words with any creature  , refuse me  , hate me  , torture me to death  !
oh  , father  , if you yourself can prove that i talked with a man at an indecent hour  , or indeed that i spoke to any creature last night  , you can disown me  , hate me  , and torture me to death  !
there is some strange misprision in the princes  .
the princes are under some strange misunderstanding  .
two of them have the very bent of honor  , and if their wisdoms be misled in this  , the practice of it lives in john the bastard  , whose spirits toil in frame of villainies  .
two of them are completely honorable  , and if they have been tricked in this  , we must blame john the bastard  , who lives to create conflict  .
pause awhile  , and let my counsel sway you in this case  .
hold on a moment  , and listen to my advice  .
your daughter here the princes left for dead  .
the princes left your daughter here for dead  .
let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed  .
hide her for a while in your house  , and tell everyone that she has  , in fact  , died  .
maintain a mourning ostentation  , and on your family 's old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial  .
make a bug show of mourning for her  , hang sad epitaphs up at your family 's tomb  , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies  .

and even though you know i 'm very close to the prince and claudio  , i swear i 'll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly  .
being that i flow in grief  , the smallest twine may lead me  .
because i 'm drowning in my grief  , i 'll grab onto the smallest piece of string dangled in front of me  .

i do love nothing in the world so well as you  .

will you not eat your word  ?
but you wo n't eat your words  ?
with no sauce that can be devised to it  .
not with any sauce they could provide for them  .
i protest i love thee  .
i swear  , i love you  .
why then  , god forgive me  .
well then  , god forgive me  !
what offense  , sweet beatrice  ?
why  , what have you done  , sweet beatrice  ?

is he not approved in the height a villain  , that hath slandered  , scorned  , dishonored my kinswoman  ?
has n't he proven himself to be a great villain slandering  , scorning  , and dishonoring my cousin  ?
oh  , that i were a man  !

what  , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then  , with public accusation  , uncovered slander  , unmitigated rancor o god  , that i were a man  !
he pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows  , and then with public accusation  , blatant slander  , pure hatred oh god  , if only i were a man  !
i would eat his heart in the marketplace  .
i would rip his heart out in public and eat it  .

sweet beatrice  , wouldst thou come when i called thee  ?
beatrice  , have you come because i called for you  ?
yea  , signior  , and depart when you bid me  .
yes  , sir  , and i 'll leave when you ask me to  .
oh  , stay but till then  !
oh  , well  , stay till then  !
only foul words  , and thereupon i will kiss thee  .
i spoke angry  , foul words to him  , and with that i will kiss you  .
foul words is but foul wind  , and foul wind is but foul breath  , and foul breath is noisome  .
if you had foul words in your mouth  , then your breath must be foul  , and foul breath is nauseating  .
therefore i will depart unkissed  .
thus  , i 'll leave without being kissed  .
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense  , so forcible is thy wit  .
your wit is so forceful  , it frightens the very meaning out of your words  .
but i must tell thee plainly  , claudio undergoes my challenge  , and either i must shortly hear from him  , or i will subscribe him a coward  .
but i will tell you this very plainly  : i have challenged claudio  , and either he 'll accept the challenge or admit he 's a coward  .
and i pray thee now tell me  , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me  ?
now  , tell me which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first  ?
for them all together  , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them  .
with all of them at once  : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix  .
but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me  ?
but tell me which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me  ?
suffer love  !
suffer love  !
a good epithet  !
that 's a good way of putting it  .
i do suffer love indeed  , for i love thee against my will  .
i do suffer love  , because i love you against my will  .
thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably  .
you and i are too wise to woo each other peacefully  .
it appears not in this confession  .
it 's said that no truly wise man will praise himself  .
there 's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself  .
if you say that you are wise  , it 's likely you 're not  .
an old  , an old instance  , beatrice  , that lived in the lime of good neighbors  .
that 's an old proverb  , beatrice  , from the time when neighbors praised each other  .
if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies  , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps  .
in this day and age  , if a man does n't erect his own monument before he dies  , he wo n't be remembered past the funeral bell 's ringing and his widow 's crying  .
and how long is that  , think you  ?
exactly how long is that  , do you think  ?
question  : why  , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum  .
about an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying  .
therefore is it most expedient for the wise  , if don worm  , his conscience  , find no impediment to the contrary  , to be the trumpet of his own virtues  , as i am to myself  .
that 's why it 's better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues  , like i do  .
so much for praising myself  , who  , i myself will bear witness  , is praiseworthy  .
that 's why i praise myself  , who if i do say so myself is quite praiseworthy  .
an now tell me  , how doth your cousin  ?
but tell me  , how is your cousin  ?
very ill  .
she 's very sick  .
and how do you  ?
and how are you  ?
very ill  , too  .
i 'm very sick  , too  .
serve god  , love me  , and mend  .
have faith  , love me  , and you will get better  .
there will i leave you too  , for here comes one in haste  .
and that 's where i 'll end  , because someone is hurrying this way  .
madam  , you must come to your uncle  .
madam  , you have to go to your uncle 's  .
yonder 's old coil at home  .
there 's a huge racket going on there  .
it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused  , the prince and claudio mightily abused  , and don john is the author of all  , who is fled and gone  .
it 's been proven that lady hero is innocent  , that the prince and claudio have been utterly deceived  , and that don john who has run away is the source of all the trouble  .
will you come presently  ?
will you come immediately  ?
will you go hear this news  , signior  ?
will you come with me to hear this news  , sir  ?
i will live in thy heart  , die in thy lap  , and be buried in thy eyes and moreover  , i will go with thee to thy uncle 's  .
i will live in your heart  , die in your lap  , and be buried in your eyes and  , what 's more  , i will go with you to your uncle 's  .
is this the monument of leonato  ?
is this the family tomb of leonato  ?
it is  , my lord  .
it is  , my lord  .
done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies  .
here lies hero  , the heroic maiden killed by slanderous words  .
death  , in guerdon of her wrongs  , gives her fame which never dies  .
to repay her for her troubles  , death gives her undying fame  .
so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame  .
so the life that died with shame lives on with fame  .
hang thou there upon the tomb  , praising her when i am dumb  .
this epitaph will hang here forever  , continuing to praise hero after i die  .
now  , music  , sound  , and sing your solemn hymn  .
now start the music  , and sing the solemn hymn  .
,  ,  .
,  .
.
,  .
.
.
,  ,  .
.
now  , unto thy bones good night  !
now i say good night to your bones  , hero  .
yearly will i do this rite  .
i will perform this ceremony every year  .
good morrow  , masters  .
good morning  , gentlemen  .
each his several way  .
we go our separate ways  .
and hymen now with luckier issue speed 's than this for whom we rendered up this woe  .
and i hope will give us better luck than hero got  .
did i not tell you she was innocent  ?
did n't i tell you she was innocent  ?
so are the prince and claudio  , who accused her upon the error that you heard debated  .
and the prince and claudio  , who accused her  , are innocent as well  , because they were deceived by don john  .
but margaret was in some fault for this  , although against her will  , as it appears in the true course of all the question  .
margaret is partially guilty  , although our investigation shows that she acted unintentionally  .
well  , i am glad that all things sort so well  .
well  , i 'm glad that everything has been sorted out  .
and so am i  , being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it  .
me too otherwise i would have had to duel with claudio  .
which i will do with confirmed countenance  .
i 'll do that  , without giving away our secret  .
friar  , i must entreat your pains  , i think  .
friar  , i think i need a favor from you  .
to do what  , signior  ?
what do you need me to do  ?
to bind me or undo me  , one of them  .
to tie me up  , or to undo me  : one or the other  .
signior leonato  , truth it is  , good signior  , your niece regards me with an eye of favor  .
signior leonato  , the truth is  , your niece likes me  .
that eye my daughter lent her  ; 't is most true  .
she sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her  , it 's true  .
and i do with an eye of love requite her  .
and i see her also through the eyes of love  .
the sight whereof i think you had from me  , from claudio and the prince  .
and those eyes were endowed with sight by claudio  , the prince  , and me  .
but what 's your will  ?
but what did you want  ?
my heart is with your liking  .
our wishes are aligned  , then  : i give you my blessing  .
and my help  .
and i 'll help you  .
here comes the prince and claudio  .
here comes the prince and claudio  .
good morrow to this fair assembly  .
good morning to all these lovely people  .
good morrow  , prince  ; good morrow  , claudio  .
good morning  , prince  ; good morning  , claudio  .
we here attend you  .
we 're waiting here for you  .
are you yet determined today to marry with my brother 's daughter  ?
are you still set on marrying my brother 's daughter  ?
i 'll hold my mind were she an ethiope  .
i would n't change my mind even if she were  .
call her forth  , brother  .
bring her out  , brother  .
here 's the friar ready  .
the friar 's ready  .
for this i owe you  .
i 'll get you for that one  .
here comes other reck'nings  .
but here are other matters to be dealt with  .
which is the lady i must seize upon  ?
which is the lady i 'm supposed to marry  ?
this same is she  , and i do give you her  .
this one  , and i will give her to you  .
why  , then she 's mine  .
well  , then she 's the one for me  .
sweet  , let me see your face  .
sweetheart  , let me see your face  .
no  , that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her  .
no  , you ca n't do that until you take her hand and  , in front of this friar  , swear to marry her  .
hero give me your hand before this holy friar  .
hero give me your hand  .
i am your husband  , if you like of me  .
with the friar as my witness  , i am your husband  , if you want me  .
another hero  !
it 's another hero  !
the former hero  !
it 's the former hero  !
hero that is dead  !
the hero that died  !
she died  , my lord  , but whiles her slander lived  .
she was only dead  , my lord  , as long as her slander lived  .
soft and fair  , friar  .
wait a moment  , friar  .
which is beatrice  ?
which one of you is beatrice  ?
i answer to that name  .
that 's my name  .
what is your will  ?
what do you want  ?
do not you love me  ?
do you love me  ?
why no  , no more than reason  .
no  , no more than is reasonable  .
why then  , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived  .
well then  , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived  .
they swore you did  .
they swore you did  .
do not you love me  ?
do you love me  ?
troth  , no  , no more than reason  .
truly  , no no more than is reasonable  .
why then  , my cousin  , margaret  , and ursula are much deceived  , for they did swear you did  .
well then  , margaret  , ursula  , and my cousin have been very much deceived  , for they swore you did  .
they swore that you were almost sick for me  .
they swore that you were sick with love for me  .
they swore that you were well - nigh dead for me  .
they swore that you were nearly dead with love for me  .
't is no such matter  .
oh  , well  .
then you do not love me  ?
so you do n't love me  ?
no  , truly  , but in friendly recompense  .
no  , i do n't except as a friend  .
come  , cousin  , i am sure you love the gentleman  .
come on  , niece  , i 'm sure you love him  .
and here 's another  , writ in my cousin 's hand  , stol'n from her pocket  , containing her affection unto benedick  .
and here 's another poem  , which i stole from my cousin 's pocket in her handwriting and all about her adoration for benedick  .
a miracle  !
what a miracle  !
here 's our own hands against our hearts  .
our handwriting gives away our hearts  .
come  , i will have thee  , but  , by this light  , i take thee for pity  .
come on  , i 'll take you  , but honestly i 'm only doing it out of pity  .
i would not deny you  , but  , by this good day  , i yield upon great persuasion  , and partly to save your life  , for i was told you were in a consumption  .
i wo n't say no to you  , but let it be known that i 'm only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life i hear you were quickly wasting away without me  .
peace  !
oh  , shut up  !
i will stop your mouth  .
i 'll stop your mouth with a kiss  .
how dost thou  , benedick  , the married man  ?
how does it feel to be benedick the married man  ?
come  , come  , we are friends  .
come on  , we 're all friends  .
let 's have a dance ere we are married  , that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives ' heels  .
let 's do a dance  , and have some fun  , before we 're wed  .
we 'll have dancing afterward  .
we 'll dance after the wedding  .
first  , of my word  !
no  , before  !
therefore play  , music  .
musicians  , play us a song  .
prince  , thou art sad  .
prince  , you look sad  .
get thee a wife  , get thee a wife  .
you should get a wife  !
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn  .
your royal staff would be so much more impressive if it were topped off by a  .
don pedro think not on him till tomorrow  .
don pedro leave him till tomorrow  .
i 'll devise thee brave punishments for him  .
i 'll think of some awful punishment for him  .
strike up  , pipers  .
play on  , musicians  !
tush  !
come on  , do n't tell me that  .
never tell me  .
i do n't like it that you knew about this  , iago  .
i take it much unkindly that thou  , iago  , who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine  , shouldst know of this  .
all this time i 've thought you were such a good friend that i 've let you spend my money as if it was yours  .
'sblood  , but you 'll not hear me  !
damn it  , you 're not listening to me  !
if ever i did dream of such a matter  , abhor me  .
i never dreamed this was happening if you find out i did  , you can go ahead and hate me  .
thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate  .
you told me you hated him  .
by heaven  , i rather would have been his hangman  .
by god  , i 'd rather be his executioner  .
why  , there 's no remedy  .
and there 's nothing i can do about it  .
't is the curse of service  .
that 's the curse of military service  .
preferment goes by letter and affection  , and not by old gradation  , where each second stood heir to th ' first  .
you get promoted when someone likes you  , not because you 're next in line  .
now sir  , be judge yourself  , whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor  .
now  , you tell me  : should i feel loyal to the moor  ?
i would not follow him then  .
if you do n't like him you should quit  .
what a full fortune does the thick - lips owe if he can carry't thus  !
sure is lucky if he can pull this off  !
do  , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when  , by night and negligence  , the fire is spied in populous cities  .
do it  , and shout like the city 's on fire  .
what  , ho  , brabantio  !
hey  , brabantio  !
signior brabantio  , ho  !
signor brabantio  , hey  !
awake  !
wake up  , brabantio  !
what  , ho  , brabantio  !
wake up  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
look to your house  , your daughter  , and your bags  !
check on your daughter  , your house  , your money  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
thieves  !
what is the reason of this terrible summons  ?
what 's the reason for this horrible shouting  ?
what is the matter there  ?
what 's the matter  ?
signior  , is all your family within  ?
sir  , is everyone in your family at home  ?
are your doors locked  ?
are your doors locked  ?
why  , wherefore ask you this  ?
why are you asking me that  ?
what  , have you lost your wits  ?
are you crazy  ?
most reverend signior  , do you know my voice  ?
do you recognize my voice  , noble lord  ?
not i .
not me  .
what are you  ?
who are you  ?
my name is roderigo  .
my name 's roderigo  .
sir  , sir  , sir
sir  , sir  , sir
but thou must needs be sure my spirits and my place have in their power to make this bitter to thee  .
you know i 'm powerful enough to make you pay for this  .
patience  , good sir  .
please wait  , sir  .
zounds  , sir  , you are one of those that will not serve god  , if the devil bid you  .
my god  , sir  , you 're stubborn and suspicious  .
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians  , you 'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse  .
we come here to help you and you treat us like thugs  , but you let an african horse climb all over your daughter  .
you 'll have your nephews neigh to you  .
your grandsons will neigh to you like horses  .
you 'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans  .
your whole family will be ruined  .
what profane wretch art thou  ?
what kind of crude jerk are you  ?
i am one  , sir  , that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs  .
the kind that tells you that the moor is having sex with your daughter right now  .
thou art a villain  !
you 're a villain  !
you are a senator  !
you 're a senator  !
this thou shalt answer  .
you 're going to pay for this  , roderigo  .
i know thee  , roderigo  .
i know who you are  .
though i do hate him as i do hell pains  , yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love  ,  ( which is indeed but sign  )  .
and affection  , even if it 's just an act  .
that you shall surely find him  , lead to the sagittary the raisd search  , and there will i be with him  .
if you want to find him  , send the search party to the sagittarius inn  .
so farewell  .
he and i will be there  .
it is too true an evil  .
it 's true  .
gone she is  .
she 's gone  .
and what 's to come of my despisd time is naught but bitterness  .
the rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness  .
now  , roderigo  , where didst thou see her  ?
now  , roderigo  , where did you see her  ?
oh  , unhappy girl  !
oh  , that miserable wretch  !
with the moor  , say'st thou  ?
you say you saw her with the moor  ?
who would be a father  ?
oh  , who would want to be a father  ?
how didst thou know 't was she  ?
how did you know it was her  ?
oh  , she deceives me past thought  !
to think she tricked me so easily  !
what said she to you  ?
what did she say to you  ?
get more tapers  , raise all my kindred  .
get me more candles  , and wake up all my relatives  .
are they married  , think you  ?
do you think they 're married  ?
truly  , i think they are  .
yes  , i really think so  .
oh  , heaven  , how got she out  ?
oh  , heaven  , how did she get out  ?
oh  , treason of the blood  !
my own flesh and blood rebels against me  !
fathers  , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act  .
fathers  , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent  .
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused  ?
are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray  ?
have you not read  , roderigo  , of some such thing  ?
have you ever heard of anything like that  , roderigo  ?
yes  , sir  , i have indeed  .
yes  , sir  , i have  .
pray you lead on  .
lead the way  .
at every house i 'll call  .
i 'll stop at every house  .
i may command at most  .
i 'm respected enough that most of them will do what i say  .
get weapons  , ho  !
get your weapons  !
and raise some special officers of might  .
and get the officers who guard the city at night  .
on  , good roderigo  .
let 's go  , roderigo  .
i will deserve your pains  .
i 'll reward you for your troubles  .
though in the trade of war i have slain men  , yet do i hold it very stuff o ' th ' conscience to do no contrived murder  .
i 've killed many men in battle  , but i still believe it 's deeply wrong to murder someone  .
i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service  .
sometimes i worry i 'm not cruel enough for this job  .
nine or ten times i had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs  .
nine or ten times i wanted to stab him under the ribs  .
't is better as it is  .
it 's better that you did n't kill him  .
nay  , but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that  , with the little godliness i have  , i did full hard forbear him  .
but he kept chattering so foolishly  , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms  , that it was hard for me to restrain myself  .
but i pray you  , sir  , are you fast married  ?
but please tell me  , sir  , is your marriage  ?
be assured of this  : that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke 's  .
brabantio is an important man in this city  , almost as powerful as the duke himself  .
he will divorce you  , or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law  ( with all his might to enforce it on  ) will give him cable  .
he 'll try to annul your marriage  , or else inflict whatever punishment the law and his power will allow him to  .
let him do his spite  .
let him do his worst  .
my services which i have done the signiory shall out - tongue his complaints  .
the services i have done for the venetian government will count for more than his complaints will  .
't is yet to know which  , when i know that boasting is an honor  , i shall promulgate  .
no one knows this yet and i do n't like to brag  , but i come from a royal family  , and i 'm as noble as the woman i 've married  .
i fetch my life and being from men of royal siege  , and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reached  .
and let me tell you  , iago  , if i did n't love desdemona as much as i do  , i 'd never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all  .
for know  , iago  , but that i love the gentle desdemona  , i would not my unhousd free condition put into circumscription and confine for the sea 's worth  .
but look at those lights  .
but look  , what lights come yond  ?
who 's coming  ?
those are the raisd father and his friends  .
that 's her father and his friends  , who 've been roused out of bed  .
you were best go in  .
you 'd better go inside  .
not i  , i must be found  .
no  , i must let them find me  .
my parts  , my title  , and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly  .
my good qualities  , my legal status as desdemona 's husband  , and my innocence will protect me  .
is it they  ?
is it them  ?
by janus  , i think no  .
i do n't think so  .
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant  ?
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant  ?
the goodness of the night upon you  , friends  !
hello  , everyone  !
what is the news  ?
what 's going on  ?
what 's the matter  , think you  ?
what do you think he wants  ?
something from cyprus as i may divine  .
something about cyprus  .
it is a business of some heat  .
i think it 's important  .
the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another 's heels  , and many of the consuls  , raised and met  , are at the duke 's already  .
the warships have sent a dozen messages tonight  , one after the other  , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the duke 's already  .
you have been hotly called for  .
they 're very anxious for you to get there  .
when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out  .
when you were n't at home  , the senate sent out three different search parties to find you  .
't is well i am found by you  .
it 's good you found me  .
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you  .
i 'll just speak a word or two here in the house and then i 'll go with you  .
ancient  , what makes he here  ?
ensign  , what 's he doing in there  ?
faith  , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack  .
tonight he boarded a treasure ship  .
if it prove lawful prize  , he 's made for ever  .
if he can keep it  , he 'll be set forever  .
i do not understand  .
i do n't understand  .
he 's married  .
he 's married  .
to who  ?
to whom  ?
marry  , to
to
come  , captain  , will you go  ?
are you ready  ?
have with you  .
yes  , i 'll go with you now  .
here comes another troop to seek for you  .
here comes another group looking for you  .
holla  !
hey  !
stand there  !
stop right there  !
signior  , it is the moor  .
sir  , it 's the moor  .
down with him  , thief  !
get him  , he 's a thief  !
you  , roderigo  !
you  , roderigo  !
come  , sir  , i am for you  .
come on  , i 'll fight you  .
o thou foul thief  , where hast thou stowed my daughter  ?
you evil thief  , where have you hidden my daughter  ?
damned as thou art  , thou hast enchanted her  !
you devil  , you 've put a spell on her  !
for i 'll refer me to all things of sense  , if she in chains of magic were not bound  , whether a maid so tender  , fair  , and happy  , so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curld darlings of our nation  , would ever have  , t ' incur a general mock  , run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear  , not to delight  .
anybody with eyes could tell you that a beautiful and happy young girl like her  , who 's refused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city  , would n't run off with a black thing like you unless she 'd been bewitched  .
judge me the world if 't is not gross in sense that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms  , abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion  .
you 're something to fear  , not to love  .
i 'll have 't disputed on  .
it 's obvious to everyone that you 've tricked her  , drugged her  , or kidnapped her  .
't is probable and palpable to thinking  .
that 's probably what happened  , so i 'm arresting you  .
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world  , a practicer of arts inhibited and out of warrant  .
arrest this man as a practitioner of black magic  .
lay hold upon him  .
grab him  .
if he do resist  , subdue him at his peril  !
if he struggles  , use force  !
to prison  , till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer  .
to prison  , until you 're called into court  .
't is true  , most worthy signior  .
it 's true  .
the duke 's in council and your noble self  , i am sure  , is sent for  .
the duke 's in a meeting right now  , and he 's sent for you too  .
indeed  , they are disproportioned  .
it 's true  , they 're inconsistent  .
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys  .
my letters say there are a hundred and seven ships  .
and mine a hundred and forty  .
and mine say a hundred and forty  .
a messenger from the galleys  .
it 's a messenger from the warships  .
now  , what 's the business  ?
why are you here  ?
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes  , so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo  .
signor angelo told me to come here and tell you that the turkish fleet is heading for rhodes  , not cyprus  .
how say you by this change  ?
what do you think about this change  ?
this can not be  , by no assay of reason  .
they ca n't have changed  ; there 's no way this could be true  .
't is a pageant  , to keep us in false gaze  .
it 's a trick to confuse us  .
when we consider th ' importancy of cyprus to the turk  , and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it  , for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks th ' abilities that rhodes is dressed in  .
think about how important cyprus is to the turks  , and remember that they could capture cyprus more easily  , since it is n't as well protected as rhodes is  .
if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskillful to leave that latest which concerns him first  , neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless  .
if we keep these things in mind  , we ca n't possibly imagine that the turks would be so incompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first  , setting aside something easy and profitable to do something dangerous and pointless  .
nay  , in all confidence  , he 's not for rhodes  .
no  , i think we can be confident that the turks are n't really headed for rhodes  .
here is more news  .
here 's some more news coming in  .
the ottomites  , reverend and gracious  , steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes  , have there injointed them with an after fleet  .
sir  , the turks sailed to rhodes  , where they joined with another fleet  .
ay  , so i thought  .
that 's just what i thought  .
how many  , as you guess  ?
how many  , can you guess  ?
of thirty sail  .
thirty ships  .
and now they do re - stem their backward course  , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus  .
now they 've turned around and are clearly heading for cyprus  .
signior montano  , your trusty and most valiant servitor  , with his free duty recommends you thus  , and prays you to believe him  .
signor montano  , your brave and loyal servant  , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him  .
't is certain then for cyprus  .
then it 's certain they 're heading for cyprus  .
marcus luccicos  , is not he in town  ?
is marcus luccicos in town  ?
he 's now in florence  .
no  , he 's in florence  .
write from us to him  .
write to him immediately  .
post - post - haste  , dispatch  .
hurry  .

my daughter  !
it 's my daughter  !
oh  , my daughter  !
oh  , my daughter  !
dead  ?
is she dead  ?
for nature so prepost'rously to err  , being not deficient  , blind  , or lame of sense  , sans witchcraft could not  .
been tricked or drugged  , because there 's no way she could have made this mistake on her own  .
we are very sorry for't  .
we 're sorry to hear this  .
othello what  , in your own part  , can you say to this  ?
othello what do you have to say for yourself  ?
nothing  , but this is so  .
nothing  , but this is true  .
but  , othello  , speak  .
tell us  , othello  .
did you by indirect and forcd courses subdue and poison this young maid 's affections  ?
did you trick or deceive this lady in some way  ?
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth  ?
or did you agree to this as equals  ?
i do beseech you  , send for the lady to the sagittary  ,
please  , send for desdemona to come here from the sagittarius inn and ask her to speak about me in front
and let her speak of me before her father  .
of her father  .
if you do find me foul in her report the trust  , the office i do hold of you  , not only take away  , but let your sentence even fall upon my life  .
if she has anything bad to say about me  , then you can sentence me to death  .
fetch desdemona hither  .
bring desdemona here  .
ancient  , conduct them  .
iago  , bring desdemona here  .
you best know the place  .
you know where she is  .
and till she come  , as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i 'll present how i did thrive in this fair lady 's love and she in mine  .
in the meantime i 'll tell you all  , as honestly as i confess my sins to god  , how i wooed this beautiful lady  , and how she came to love me  .
say it  , othello  .
tell us  , othello  .
i pray you  , hear her speak  .
please let her speak  .
if she confess that she was half the wooer  , destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man  .
if she admits she wanted this  , then i wo n't blame othello  .
come hither  , gentle mistress  .
come here  , my child  .
do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience  ?
who do you obey here  ?
my noble father  , i do perceive here a divided duty  .
father  , this is n't easy for me  .
to you i am bound for life and education  .
i 'm torn  .
my life and education both do learn me how to respect you  .
i owe you respect because you gave me life and education  .
you are the lord of duty  .
you 're the one i have to obey  .
i am hitherto your daughter  .
i 'm your daughter  .
but here 's my husband  .
but this man here is my husband now  , and i owe him as much as my mother owed you  , just as she preferred you to her own father  .
and so much duty as my mother showed to you  , preferring you before her father  , so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord  .
so i have to give my obedience to the moor  , my husband  .
god be with you  .
i 'm finished  , then  .
i have done  .
duke  , please go ahead with your state business  .
please it your grace  , on to the state affairs  .
i 'd rather adopt a child than have one of my own  .
i had rather to adopt a child than get it  .
come here  , moor  .
come hither  , moor  .
i 'm forced to give my blessing to this marriage  .
i here do give thee that with all my heart which  , but thou hast already  , with all my heart i would keep from thee  .
with all my heart  , i give you that thing which  , if you did n't already have it  , i 'd try with all my heart to keep from you  .
for your sake  , jewel  , i am glad at soul i have no other child  .
desdemona  , i 'm glad you 're my only child  , since if i had others i 'd keep them all locked up  .
for thy escape would teach me tyranny  , to hang clogs on them  .
you would have made me treat them like a tyrant  .
i have done  , my lord  .
i 'm done  , my lord  .
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which  , as a grise or step  , may help these lovers  .
let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers  : if you ca n't change something  , do n't cry about it  .
when remedies are past  , the griefs are ended by seeing the worst  , which late on hopes depended  .
when you lament something bad that 's already happened  , you 're setting yourself up for more
why  , at her father 's  .
she can stay at her father 's house  .
i 'll not have it so  .
i wo n't allow it  .
nor i  .
neither will i  .
what would you  , desdemona  ?
what do you want to do  , desdemona  ?
let her have your voice  .
please allow her to do this  .
vouch with me  , heaven  , i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite  ,
i 'm not asking to have her near me for sex i 'm too old for that  , and my sexual
you must away tonight  .
you 'll have to leave tonight  .
with all my heart  .
with all my heart  , i 'll go right away  .
at nine i ' th ' morning here we 'll meet again  .
we 'll meet again at nine in the morning  .
othello  , leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you  , and such things else of quality and respect as doth import you  .
othello  , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you  .
let it be so  .
all right  , then  .
good night to every one  .
good night  , everyone  .
( brabantio  ) and  , noble signior  , if virtue no delighted beauty lack  , your son - in - law is far more fair than black  .
brabantio sir  , if goodness is beautiful  , your son - in - law is beautiful  , not black  .
adieu  , brave moor  .
goodbye  , black moor  .
use desdemona well  .
treat desdemona well  .
look to her  , moor  , if thou hast eyes to see  .
keep an eye on her  , moor  .
she has deceived her father  , and may thee  .
she lied to me  , and she may lie to you  .
my life upon her faith  !
i 'd bet my life she 'd never lie to me  .
honest iago  , my desdemona must i leave to thee  .
iago  , i 'm leaving my dear desdemona with you  .
i prithee  , let thy wife attend on her  , and bring them after in the best advantage  .
have your wife attend to her  , and bring them along as soon as you can  .
come  , desdemona  , i have but an hour of love  , of worldly matter and direction  , to spend with thee  .
come on  , desdemona  , i 've only got an hour of love to spend with you  , to tell you what you need to do  .
we must obey the time  .
we 're on a tight schedule  .
iago  .
iago  .
what say'st thou  , noble heart  ?
what do you have to say  , noble friend  ?
what will i do  , think'st thou  ?
what do you think i should do  ?
why  , go to bed  , and sleep  .
go to bed  , and sleep  .
i will incontinently drown myself  .
i 'm going to go drown myself  .
if thou dost i shall never love thee after  .
if you do that  , i 'll never respect you again  .
why  , thou silly gentleman  !
why  , you silly man  !
oh  , villainous  !
oh  , how stupid  !
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years  , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself  .
i 've been alive for twenty - eight years  , and i 've never met a man who knew what was good for him  .
ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen  , i would change my humanity with a baboon  .
i 'd rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman i ca n't have  .
what should i do  ?
what should i do  ?
i confess it is my shame to be so fond  , but it is not in my virtue to amend it  .
i know it 's foolish to be so much in love  , but i ca n't help it  .
it can not be  .
i do n't believe it  .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will  .
you feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower  .
come  , be a man  .
come on  , be a man  .
drown thyself  ?
drown yourself  ?
drown cats and blind puppies  !
drowning is for cats or blind puppies do n't drown yourself  !
i have professed me thy friend  , and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness  .
i 've told you i 'm your friend  , and i 'll stick by you  .
wilt thou be fast to my hopes  , if i depend on the issue  ?
can i count on you if i wait to see what happens  ?
where shall we meet i ' th ' morning  ?
where will we meet in the morning  ?
at my lodging  .
at my house  .
i 'll be with thee betimes  .
i 'll be there early  .
what say you  ?
what is it  ?
no more of drowning  , do you hear  ?
no more talk about killing yourself  , okay  ?
i am changed  .
i 've changed my mind about that  .
go to  , farewell  .
go then  , goodbye  .
put money enough in your purse  .
put a lot of cash together  .
i 'll sell all my land  .
i 'm going to sell all my land  .
thus do i ever make my fool my purse  .
that 's how i always do it  , getting money from fools  .
for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit  .
i 'd be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if i could n't get something useful out of him  .
i hate the moor  , and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets he 's done my office  .
i hate the moor  , and there 's a widespread rumor that he 's slept with my wife  .
i know not if 't be true  , but i  , for mere suspicion in that kind  , will do as if for surety  .
i 'm not sure it 's true  , but just the suspicion is enough for me  .
he holds me well  .
he thinks highly of me  .
the better shall my purpose work on him  .
that 'll help  .
cassio 's a proper man  .
cassio 's a handsome man  .
let me see now  ,
let 's see  , how can i
what from the cape can you discern at sea  ?
what can you see out on the ocean  ?
a segregation of the turkish fleet  .
the turkish navy will be broken up  .
for do but stand upon the foaming shore  , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds  , the wind - shaked surge  , with high and monstrous mane  , seems to cast water on the burning bear  , and quench the guards of th ' ever - fixd pole  .
the wind 's whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky  .
i never did like molestation view on the enchafd flood  .
i 've never seen the waters so disturbed  .
if that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed  , they are drowned  .
if the turkish fleet is n't protected in some harbor  , their men must all be drowned  .
it is impossible they bear it out  .
no ship could survive this storm  .
news  , lads  , our wars are done  !
i 've got news  , boys  , the war 's over  !
the desperate tempest hath so banged the turks  , that their designment halts  .
this terrible storm has smashed the turks so badly that their plans are ruined  .
a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet  .
one of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked  .
how  ?
what  ?
is this true  ?
is this true  ?
i am glad on 't  .
i 'm happy about that  .
't is a worthy governor  .
he 'll be a good governor  .
but this same cassio  , though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss  , yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe  .
cassio brings good news about the turkish defeat  , but he 's worried about the othello 's safety  .
for they were parted with foul and violent tempest  .
the two of them were separated during the storm  .
come  , let 's do so  .
let 's do that  .
for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance  .
every minute we expect more ships to arrive  .
thanks  , you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor  .
thanks  , you brave men who defend this island and respect othello  .
oh  , let the heavens give him defense against the elements  , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea  .
i hope heaven protects him from the weather  , because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea  .
is he well shipped  ?
is his ship sturdy  ?
what noise  ?
what 's all that shouting about  ?
my hopes do shape him for the governor  .
i hope it 's othello  .
i pray you sir  , go forth and give us truth who 't is that is arrived  .
please go find out for certain who has arrived  .
i shall  .
i 'll do that  .
but good lieutenant  , is your general wived  ?
good lieutenant  , is your general married  ?
't is one iago  , ancient to the general  .
a man named iago  , the general 's ensign  .
what is she  ?
who 's that  ?
oh  , behold  , the riches of the ship is come on shore  !
look  , the precious desdemona has arrived on shore  .
you men of cyprus  , let her have your knees  .
we should all kneel before her  , men of cyprus  !
hail to thee  , lady  , and the grace of heaven  , before  , behind thee  , and on every hand  , enwheel thee round  !
greetings  , my lady  , and may god always be with you  .
i thank you  , valiant cassio  .
thank you  , brave cassio  .
what tidings can you tell me of my lord  ?
is there any news about my husband  ?
he is not yet arrived  .
he has n't arrived yet  .
nor know i aught but that he 's well and will be shortly here  .
as far as i know  , he 's okay and will arrive here soon  .
oh  , but i fear  .
oh  , but i 'm worried  .
how lost you company  ?
how did you two get separated  ?
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship
the storm separated us  .
see for the news  .
go find out the news  .
good ancient  , you are welcome  .
ensign iago  , welcome  .
welcome  , mistress  .
and welcome to you  , too  , madam  .
emilia let it not gall your patience  , good iago  , that i extend my manners  .
emilia do n't be upset that i kissed your wife hello  , iago  .
't is my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy  .
it 's a courtesy where i come from  .
sir  , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me  , you 'll have enough  .
if she gave you as much lip as she gives me  , you 'd be sick of her by now  .
alas  , she has no speech  !
on the contrary  , she 's a soft - spoken woman  .
you have little cause to say so  .
you have no reason to say that  .
oh  , fie upon thee  , slanderer  !
shame on you  , you slanderer  !
nay  , it is true  , or else i am a turk  .
no  , it 's true  , or if it 's not  , i 'm a villain  .
you rise to play and go to bed to work  .
you wake up to have fun  , and you start work when you go to bed  .
you shall not write my praise  .
you clearly have nothing good to say about me  .
no  , let me not  .
no  , i do n't  .
what wouldst thou write of me  , if thou should'st praise me  ?
but if you had to say something nice about me  , what would you say  ?
come on  , assay  .
come on  , just try  .
there 's one gone to the harbor  ?
by the way  , has someone gone down to the harbor  ?
ay  , madam  .
yes  , madam  .
well praised  !
very clever  !
how if she be black and witty  ?
but what if the woman is smart but ugly  ?
if she be black  , and thereto have a wit  , she 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit  .
even if she 's ugly  , she 'll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her  .
worse and worse  !
this is getting worse and worse  !
how if fair and foolish  ?
what if she 's pretty but stupid  ?
she never yet was foolish that was fair  , for even her folly helped her to an heir  .
no pretty woman is stupid  , because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men  .
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ' th ' alehouse  .
these are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars  .
what miserable praise hast thou for her that 's foul and foolish  ?
what horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who 's both ugly and stupid  ?
there 's none so foul and foolish thereunto  , but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do  .
no matter how ugly or stupid the woman is  , she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do  .
oh  , heavy ignorance  !
you do n't know a thing  !
thou praisest the worst best  .
you give your best praise to the worst women  .
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed  , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself  ?
but how would you praise a truly good woman  , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her  ?
she that was ever fair and never proud  , had tongue at will and yet was never loud  , never lacked gold and yet went never gay  , fled from her wish and yet said now i may  , she that being angered  , her revenge being nigh  , bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly  , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod 's head for the salmon 's tail  , she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind  , see suitors following and not look behind  , she was a wight  , if ever such wights were
a woman who was beautiful but never proud  , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet  , who dressed well but was never overdressed  , who had self - restraint even when she could get what she wanted  , a woman who never took revenge  , who overlooked it when people hurt her  , who was too wise to do anything stupid  , who could think without revealing her thoughts  , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her  , that kind of woman  , if she ever existed  , would
to do what  ?
would do what  ?
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer  .
would raise babies and clip coupons  .
oh  , most lame and impotent conclusion  !
oh  , that 's pathetic  !
do not learn of him  , emilia  , though he be thy husband  .
do n't listen to him  , emilia  , even though he 's your husband  .
how say you  , cassio  ?
what do you think about him  , cassio  ?
is he not a most profane and liberal counselor  ?
is n't he a horrible man  ?
he speaks home  , madam  .
he speaks bluntly  , madam  .
you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar  .
he 's more of a soldier than a wise man  .
the moor  !
that 's the moor  !
i know his trumpet  .
i recognize his trumpet  .
't is truly so  .
yes  , it is  .
let 's meet him and receive him  .
let 's go greet him when he lands  .
lo  , where he comes  !
look  , here he comes  .
oh my fair warrior  !
my beautiful warrior  !
my dear othello  !
my darling othello  !
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me  .
i 'm amazed you got here before me  .
oh  , my soul 's joy  !
but i 'm overjoyed  !
if after every tempest come such calms  , may the winds blow till they have wakened death  , and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas olympus - high  , and duck again as low as hell 's from heaven  !
my love  , if the calm after the storm could always be this wonderful  , i 'd want the wind to blow until it waked the dead  , and whipped up waves as tall as mountains  !
if it were now to die  , 'twere now to be most happy  , for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate  .
if i died right now i 'd be completely happy  , since i 'll probably never be as happy as this again in my life  .
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase  , even as our days do grow  .
god willing  , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older  .
amen to that  , sweet powers  !
amen to that  !
i can not speak enough of this content  .
i ca n't talk about my happiness anymore  .
it stops me here  , it is too much of joy  .
it 's too much  .
and this  , and this  , the greatest discords be that e'er our hearts shall make  !
i hope these kisses i 'm about to give you are the closest we ever come to fighting  .
oh  , you are well tuned now  , but i 'll set down the pegs that make this music  , as honest as i am  .
oh  , you 're happy now  , but i 'll ruin your happiness  , for all my supposed honesty  .
with him  ?
with cassio  ?
why  , 't is not possible  .
that 's impossible  .
lay thy finger thus  , and let thy soul be instructed  .
be quiet and listen to me  .
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor  , but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies  .
remember how she fell madly in love with the moor because he bragged and told her made - up stories  ?
to love him still for prating  ?
did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering  ?
let not thy discreet heart think it  .
you 're too smart to think that  .
her eye must be fed  , and what delight shall she have to look on the devil  ?
no  , she needs someone nice - looking  .
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport  , there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite  , loveliness in favor  , sympathy in years  , manners and beauties  .
othello 's ugly  , what pleasure could she find in him  ?
all which the moor is defective in  .
lovemaking gets boring after a while  .
now for want of these required conveniences  , her delicate tenderness will find itself abused  , begin to heave the gorge  , disrelish and abhor the moor  .
to keep things hot  , she 'll need to see someone with a handsome face  , someone close to her in age  , someone who looks and acts like her  .
very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice  .
othello is n't any of those things  .
now sir  , this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does  ?
since he does n't have these advantages to make him attractive to her  , she 'll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke  .
a knave very voluble  , no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming  , for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection  .
she 'll start looking around for a second choice  .
why  , none  , why  , none  !
now  , if that 's true and it 's obviously true who 's in a better position than cassio  ?
a slipper and subtle knave  , a finder of occasions that has an eye  , can stamp and counterfeit advantages  , though true advantage never present itself  .
he 's a smooth talker  , and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust  .
a devilish knave  .
nobody 's as crafty as he is  .
besides  , the knave is handsome  , young  , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after  .
besides  , he 's young and handsome  , and he 's got all the qualities that nave and silly girls go for  .
a pestilent complete knave  , and the woman hath found him already  .
he 's a bad boy  , and desdemona 's got her eye on him already  .
blessed fig's - end  !
like hell she is  !
the wine she drinks is made of grapes  .
she 's made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else  .
if she had been blessed  , she would never have loved the moor  .
if she were so moral  , she would never have fallen in love with the moor in the first place  .
blessed pudding  !
good lord  !
didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand  ?
did you notice how she and cassio were fondling each other 's hands  ?
didst not mark that  ?
did you see that  ?
well  .
all right  .
i will do this  , if you can bring it to any opportunity  .
i 'll do it  , if you help me out  .
i warrant thee  .
i promise i will  .
meet me by and by at the citadel  .
meet me in a little while at the citadel  .
i must fetch his necessaries ashore  .
i need to get othello 's things from the ship  .
farewell  .
goodbye  .
adieu  .
goodbye  .
good michael  , look you to the guard tonight  .
good michael  , keep a careful eye on the guards tonight  .
let 's teach ourselves that honorable stop not to outsport discretion  .
let 's exercise restraint and not let the party get too wild  .
welcome  , iago  .
hello  , iago  .
we must to the watch  .
it 's time for us to stand guard  .
she 's a most exquisite lady  .
she 's an exquisitely beautiful lady  .
and  , i 'll warrant her  , full of game  .
and i bet she 's good in bed too  .
indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature  .
yes  , she 's young and tender  .
what an eye she has  !
and such pretty eyes  !
methinks it sounds a parley to provocation  .
like an invitation  .
and when she speaks  , is it not an alarum to love  ?
and when she speaks  , does n't her voice stir up passion  ?
she is indeed perfection  .
she 's a perfect woman  , it 's true  .
not tonight  , good iago  .
not tonight  , iago  .
i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking  .
i 'm not much of a drinker  .
i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment  .
i wish there was less social pressure to drink  .
oh  , they are our friends  .
oh  , but these are our friends  .
but one cup  .
just one glass  .
i 'll drink for you  .
i 'll do most of the drinking for you  .
where are they  ?
where are they  ?
here at the door  .
by the door  .
i pray you call them in  .
please invite them in  .
i 'll do 't  , but it dislikes me  .
i 'll do it  , but i do n't like it  .
if i can fasten but one cup upon him  , with that which he hath drunk tonight already  , he 'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress ' dog  .
if i can just get him to drink one more glass after what he 's drunk already  , he 'll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog  .
now my sick fool roderigo  , whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out  , to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottle - deep  , and he 's to watch  .
that fool roderigo  , all twisted up inside with love  , has been drinking toasts to desdemona by the gallon  , and he 's on guard duty .
three lads of cyprus  , noble swelling spirits  ( that hold their honors in a wary distance  , the very elements of this warlike isle  ) have i tonight flustered with flowing cups  , and they watch too  .
i 've gotten the rest of the guards drunk  , as well as several gentlemen from cyprus who are quick to take offense  .
now 'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle  .
now i 'll get cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island  .
but here they come  .
here they come  .
if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely  , both with wind and stream  .
if the future turns out as i hope it will  , i 'm all set for success  .
'fore heaven  , they have given me a rouse already  .
my god  , they 've given me a lot to drink  .
good faith  , a little one  , not past a pint  , as i am a soldier  .
no  , it was a little one  , not more than a pint  .
fore heaven  , an excellent song  .
my god  , what a great song  !
i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting  .
i learned it in england  , where they have a talent for drinking  .
your dane  , your german  , and your swag - bellied hollander drink  , ho  !
the danes  , the germans  , and the dutch come on  , drink  , drink  !
are nothing to your english  .
are nothing compared to the english  .
is your englishman so expert in his drinking  ?
are englishmen really such heavy drinkers  ?
why  , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk  ; he sweats not to overthrow your almain  .
they drink danes under the table  , and it takes them no effort at all to out - drink germans  .
he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled  .
and the dutch are vomiting while the english are asking for refills  .
to the health of our general  !
let 's drink to our general  !
why  , this is a more exquisite song than the other  .
god  , that song 's even better than the other one  .
will you hear 't again  ?
do you want to hear it again  ?
no  , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things  .
no  , because we should n't be doing that stuff  .
well  , heaven 's above all  , and there be souls must be saved  , and there be souls must not be saved  .
oh well  , god 's in charge  , and some people have to go to heaven  , while other people have to go to hell  .
it 's true  , good lieutenant  .
that 's true  , lieutenant  .
for mine own part  , no offence to the general nor any man of quality  , i hope to be saved  .
speaking for myself and no offense to the general or anyone else i hope i 'm going to heaven  .
and so do i too  , lieutenant  .
me too  , lieutenant  .
excellent well  !
yes  , you 're speaking very well  .
why  , very well then  .
yes  , very well  .
you must not think then that i am drunk  .
so do n't think that i 'm drunk  .
to th ' platform  , masters  .
let 's go to the platform where we 'll stand guard  .
come  , let 's set the watch  .
come on  .
but is he often thus  ?
but is he often like this  ?
't is evermore the prologue to his sleep  .
he drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep  .
he 'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle  .
he 'd stay up all night and all day if he did n't drink himself to sleep  .
it were well the general were put in mind of it  .
the general should be informed about this  .
perhaps he sees it not  , or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils  .
maybe he 's never noticed  , or he only wants to see cassio 's good side  .
is not this true  ?
do n't you think so  ?
and 't is great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity  .
and it 's too bad that the moor chose a man with such a deep - rooted drinking problem as his second - in - command  .
it were an honest action to say so to the moor  .
we should definitely say something to the moor  .
not i  , for this fair island  .
i would n't say anything  , not if you gave me the whole island for doing so  .
i do love cassio well  , and would do much to cure him of this evil
i respect cassio and i 'd like to help cure his alcoholism
what 's the matter  , lieutenant  ?
what 's the matter  , lieutenant  ?
a knave teach me my duty  ?
to think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners  !
i 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle  .
i 'll beat him until the welts look like basket - weave  !
beat me  ?
you 'll beat me  ?
let me go  , sir  , or i 'll knock you o'er the mazzard  .
let me go  , or i 'll knock you on the head  .
come  , come  , you 're drunk  .
come on  , you 're drunk  .
drunk  ?
drunk  ?
roderigo away  , i say  , go out  , and cry a mutiny  .
roderigo go tell everyone there 's a riot  .
who 's that which rings the bell  ?
who 's sounding that alarm  ?
diablo  , ho  !
the whole town will riot  !
the town will rise  .
god  , lieutenant  , please stop  !
fie  , fie  , lieutenant  , you 'll be ashamed for ever  .
you 'll be ashamed of this forever  !
what is the matter here  ?
what is the matter here  ?
hold  , for your lives  !
stop right now  !
swords out  , and tilting one at other 's breasts in opposition bloody  .
know what could have started this  .
i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds  , and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it  .
i 'd rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this  !
how comes it  , michael  , you are thus forgot  ?
how did you manage to lose your self - control like this  , michael  ?
if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier  .
i know you 're close to cassio  , but if you diverge from the truth in any way  , you 're not a true soldier  .
but men are men  , the best sometimes forget  .
but nobody 's perfect  , and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage  .
though cassio did some little wrong to him  , as men in rage strike those that wish them best  , yet surely cassio  , i believe  , received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass  .
cassio was wrong to hurt montano  , who was only trying to help him  , but i 'm sure the guy who ran away must have offended cassio in some terrible way  , and cassio could n't let it pass  .
i know  , iago  , thy honesty and love doth mince this matter  , making it light to cassio  .
iago  , i know you 're fond of cassio and are downplaying this for his benefit  .
cassio  , i love thee but never more be officer of mine  .
cassio  , i love you  , but you 're never again going to be one of my officers  .
look  , if my gentle love be not raised up  !
look  , you 've woken my wife  !
i 'll make thee an example  .
i 'll make you an example for the others to learn from  .
what 's the matter  , dear  ?
what 's the matter  , dear  ?
what  , are you hurt  , lieutenant  ?
are you hurt  , lieutenant  ?
ay  , past all surgery  .
yes  , but no doctor can help me  .
marry  , heaven forbid  !
oh i hope that 's not true  !
reputation  , reputation  , reputation  !
my reputation  , my reputation  !
oh  , i have lost my reputation  !
i 've lost my reputation  , the longest - living and truest part of myself  !
i have lost the immortal part of myself  , and what remains is bestial  .
everything else in me is just animal - like  .
my reputation  , iago  , my reputation  !
oh  , my reputation  , iago  , my reputation  !
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight  , so drunken  , and so indiscreet an officer  .
i 'd rather ask him to hate me than ask such a good commander to accept such a worthless  , drunk  , stupid officer as myself  .
drunk  ?
drunk  ?
and speak parrot  ?
babbling senselessly  ?
and squabble  ?
squabbling  ?
swagger  ?
swaggering  ?
swear  ?
swearing  ?
and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow  ?
ranting and raving to my own shadow  !
o thou invisible spirit of wine  , if thou hast no name to be known by  , let us call thee devil  !
oh  , wine is the devil  !
what was he that you followed with your sword  ?
who were you chasing with your sword  ?
what had he done to you  ?
what did he do to you  ?
i know not  .
i do n't know  .
is 't possible  ?
is that possible  ?
i remember a mass of things  , but nothing distinctly  .
i remember a jumble of impressions  , but nothing distinctly  .
a quarrel  , but nothing wherefore  .
i remember a fight  , but not why we were fighting  .
oh  , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains  !
oh god  , why do men drink and lose their minds  ?
that we should  , with joy  , pleasance revel and applause  , transform ourselves into beasts  !
why do we party until we 're like animals  ?
why  , but you are now well enough  .
you seem all right now  .
how came you thus recovered  ?
how did you get better  ?
it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath  .
my drunkenness went away when anger took over  .
one unperfectness shows me another  , to make me frankly despise myself  .
one weakness led to another  , to make me hate myself  .
come  , you are too severe a moraler  .
come on  , you 're being too hard on yourself  .
as the time  , the place  , and the condition of this country stands  , i could heartily wish this had not befallen  .
i wish none of this had happened  , given the situation here  , and your rank  .
but since it is as it is  , mend it for your own good  .
but since this has happened  , you should fix it for your own good  .
i will ask him for my place again  , he shall tell me i am a drunkard  .
i 'll ask him for my position back again  , and he 'll tell me i 'm a drunk  .
had i as many mouths as hydra  , such an answer would stop them all  .
even if i had a whole bunch of mouths  , i would n't be able to answer that  .
to be now a sensible man  , by and by a fool  , and presently a beast  !
i was a reasonable man  , then i became a fool  , and finally a beast  !
oh  , strange  !
oh  , how strange  !
every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil  .
every glass of liquor is damned  , and the devil 's the main ingredient  !
come  , come  , good wine is a good familiar creature  , if it be well used  .
come on now  , wine is good for you  , if you know how to use it  .
exclaim no more against it  .
do n't say anything bad about wine anymore  .
and  , good lieutenant  , i think you think i love you  .
lieutenant  , i think you know i 'm your friend  .
i have well approved it  , sir  .
i know that  , sir  .
i drunk  !
imagine  , me  , a drunk  !
you advise me well  .
that 's good advice  .
i protest  , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness  .
i 'm helping you because i like and respect you  .
good night  , honest iago  .
good night  , honest iago  .
how now  , roderigo  !
hello  , roderigo  !
how poor are they that have not patience  !
you 're a poor man if you 're this impatient  !
what wound did ever heal but by degrees  ?
if you get hurt  , does your wound heal immediately  ?
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft  , and wit depends on dilatory time  .
no  , it heals gradually  .
does't not go well  ?
we achieve things with our intelligence  , not by magic  , and intelligent planning takes time  .
cassio hath beaten thee  .
are n't things going well  ?
and thou  , by that small hurt  , hath cashiered cassio  .
cassio 's beaten you up  , but with that tiny sacrifice on your part  , you got cassio discharged  !
though other things grow fair against the sun  , yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe  .
if we 're patient  , we 'll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors  .
content thyself awhile  .
my god  , it 's morning  .
in troth  , 't is morning  .
all this excitement has made the time fly by  .
pleasure and action make the hours seem short  .
go back to where you 're staying and go to sleep  .
retire thee  , go where thou art billeted  .
go on  , i 'm telling you  .
away  , i say  , thou shalt know more hereafter  .
you 'll understand better later  .
nay  , get thee gone  .
go  .
are these  , i pray you  , wind instruments  ?
are these wind instruments  ?
ay  , marry  , are they  , sir  .
yes  , they are  .
oh  , thereby hangs a tail  .
oh  , there 's the problem  .
whereby hangs a tale  , sir  ?
what 's the problem  ?
well  , sir  , we will not  .
well  , we 'll stop  , then  .
if you have any music that may not be heard  , to 't again  .
if you 've got any music that ca n't be heard  , then play that  .
but  , as they say  , to hear music the general does not greatly care  .
but as i said  , the general is n't really in the mood to hear music now  .
we have none such  , sir  .
we do n't have any music that ca n't be heard  .
then put up your pipes in your bag  , for i 'll away  .
then pack up your instruments and go away  .
go  , vanish into air  , away  !
go  !
dost thou hear  , my honest friend  ?
do you hear  , my friend  ?
prithee  , keep up thy quillets  .
please do n't play games  .
there 's a poor piece of gold for thee  .
( cassio clown  .
if the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife be stirring  , tell her there 's one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech  .
there 's a bit of gold for you  .
wilt thou do this  ?
when the woman taking care of the general 's wife wakes up  , could you please tell her that cassio asks to speak with her  ?
she is stirring  , sir  .
she 's awake  , sir  .
if she will stir hither  , i shall seem to notify unto her  .
if she feels like coming over here  , i 'll give her your message  .
in happy time  , iago  .
good to see you  , iago  .
you have not been abed  , then  ?
you did n't go to sleep  , then  ?
i humbly thank you for't  .
i humbly thank you  .
i never knew a florentine more kind and honest  .
even for a  , i never knew someone so kind and honest  .
good morrow  , good lieutenant  .
good morning  , lieutenant  .
i am sorry for your displeasure  , but all will sure be well  .
i 'm sorry about what happened  , but i 'm sure everything will turn out all right  .
the general and his wife are talking of it  , and she speaks for you stoutly  .
the general and his wife are talking about it now  , and she 's defending you strongly  .
the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity  , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you  .
the moor says the man you hurt is very important in cyprus  , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you  .
but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again  .
but he says he still loves and respects you  , and based on his own feelings alone he 's looking for an opportunity to safely take you back  .
yet i beseech you  , if you think fit  , or that it may be done  , give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone  .
please find a way to give me some time alone with desdemona  , if you think that 's all right  .
pray you come in  .
please come in  .
i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely  .
i 'll take you to a place where you can speak freely  .
i am much bound to you  .
thank you very much  .
well  , my good lord  , i 'll do 't  .
i will  , my lord  .
this fortification  , gentlemen  , shall we see 't  ?
shall we go see this fortification  , men  ?
we 'll wait upon your lordship  .
we 're at your service  , my lord  .
be thou assured  , good cassio  , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf  .
i 'll do everything i can for you  , cassio  .
good madam  , do  .
please do  , madam  .
i warrant it grieves my husband as if the cause were his  .
my husband 's so upset about cassio 's problem you 'd think it was his own  .
bounteous madam  , whatever shall become of michael cassio  , he 's never anything but your true servant  .
my dear beautiful lady  , whatever happens to michael cassio  , he 'll always be your humble servant  .
do not doubt that  .
that 'll never happen  .
before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place  .
emilia here will be my witness  : i promise you that you 'll get your position back again  .
assure thee  , if i do vow a friendship  , i 'll perform it to the last article  .
and if i promise to help someone  , i do everything i can  .
my lord shall never rest  , i 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience  .
my husband will never get a moment 's rest  , i 'll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
madam  , here comes my lord  .
madam  , here comes your husband  .
madam  , i 'll take my leave  .
madam  , i 'd better leave now  .
why  , stay and hear me speak  .
why not stay and hear me talk to him  ?
madam  , not now  .
no  , madam  .
i am very ill at ease  , unfit for mine own purposes  .
i 'm very uncomfortable  , and that wo n't help my case  .
well  , do your discretion  .
well  , do whatever you think best  .
ha  !
hey  !
i like not that  .
i do n't like that  .
what dost thou say  ?
what did you say  ?
nothing  , my lord  , or if i know not what  .
nothing  , my lord  , or if i did i do n't know what  .
was not that cassio parted from my wife  ?
was n't that cassio leaving my wife  ?
i do believe 't was he  .
i really think it was him  .
how now  , my lord  ?
what 's this  , my lord  ?
i have been talking with a suitor here  , a man that languishes in your displeasure  .
i was talking to a petitioner here just now  , someone who 's suffering from your anger  .
who is 't you mean  ?
who do you mean  ?
why  , your lieutenant  , cassio  .
your lieutenant  , cassio  .
good my lord  , if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take  .
oh  , if i 've got any influence over you at all  , please patch things up with him  .
for if he be not one that truly loves you  , that errs in ignorance and not in cunning  , i have no judgment in an honest face  .
in my judgment  , this man truly loves you  , and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked  .
i prithee  , call him back  .
please call him and tell him to come back here  .
went he hence now  ?
was that him just now  ?
not now  , sweet desdemona  .
not now  , my sweet desdemona  .
some other time  .

no  , not tonight  .
no  , not tonight  .
tomorrow dinner  , then  ?

i will deny thee nothing  !
i wo n't deny you anything  !
whereon i do beseech thee  , grant me this  , to leave me but a little to myself  .
but in return  , please  , do one thing for me  : leave me alone for a little while  .
shall i deny you  ?
would i ever deny you anything  ?
no  .
no  .
farewell  , my lord  .
goodbye  , my husband  .
farewell  , my desdemona  .
goodbye  , my desdemona  .
i 'll come to thee straight  .
i 'll come see you right away  .
excellent wretch  !
what a wonderful girl  !
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee  !
god help me  , i love you  !
and when i love thee not chaos is come again  .
and when i stop loving you  , the universe will fall back into the chaos that was there when time began  .
my noble lord
my noble lord
what dost thou say  , iago  ?
what is it  , iago  ?
did michael cassio  , when you wooed my lady  , know of your love  ?
when you were wooing desdemona  , did michael cassio know about it  ?
he did  , from first to last  .
yes  , he knew about it the whole time  .
why dost thou ask  ?
why do you ask  ?
why of thy thought  , iago  ?
why are you curious  , iago  ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her  .
i did n't realize he knew her  .
indeed  ?
oh  , really  ?
indeed  ?
oh  , really  ?
ay  , indeed  !
yes  , really  .
discern'st thou aught in that  ?
do you see something wrong with that  ?
is he not honest  ?
is n't he an honest man  ?
honest  , my lord  ?
honest  , my lord  ?
honest  , ay  , honest  .
honest  , yes  , honest  .
my lord  , for aught i know  .
as far as i know  , sir  .
what dost thou think  ?
what are you thinking  ?
think  , my lord  ?
thinking  , my lord  ?
think  , my lord  ?
thinking  , my lord  ?
alas  , thou echo'st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown  .
my god  , you keep repeating everything i say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud  .
thou dost mean something  .
you 're thinking something  .
i heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that when cassio left my wife  .
just a minute ago i heard you say you did n't like it when cassio left my wife  .
what didst not like  ?
what did n't you like  ?
and when i told thee he was of my counsel of my whole course of wooing  , thou cried'st indeed  ?
and when i told you he was involved the whole time i was trying to get desdemona  , you were like  , oh  , really  ?
and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit  .
and then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible  .
if thou dost love me show me thy thought  .
if you 're my friend  , tell me what you 're thinking  .
my lord  , you know i love you  .
my lord  , you know i 'm your friend  .
for michael cassio  , i dare be sworn  , i think  , that he is honest  .
as for michael cassio  , i think it would be safe for me to swear that he 's honest  .
i think so too  .
i think so too  .
certain  , men should be what they seem  .
absolutely  , people should be what they appear to be  .
why then i think cassio 's an honest man  .
in that case  , i think cassio 's an honest man  .
nay  , yet there 's more in this  .
no  , i think there 's more to this than you 're letting on  .
i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings  , as thou dost ruminate  , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words  .
please tell me what you 're thinking even your worst suspicions  .
thou dost conspire against thy friend  , iago  , if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts  .
you 're not being a good friend  , iago  , if you even your friend has been wronged and you do n't tell him about it  .
nor for my manhood  , honesty  , and wisdom to let you know my thoughts  .
it would n't be wise  , honest  , or responsible for me to tell them  .
what dost thou mean  ?
what are you talking about  ?
good name in man and woman  , dear my lord  , is the immediate jewel of their souls  .
a good reputation is the most valuable thing we have men and women alike  .
who steals my purse steals trash  .
if you steal my money  , you 're just stealing trash  .
't is something  , nothing  : 't was mine  , 't is his  , and has been slave to thousands  .
it 's something  , it 's nothing  : it 's yours  , it 's mine  , and it 'll belong to thousands more  .
but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed  .
but if you steal my reputation  , you 're robbing me of something that does n't make you richer  , but makes me much poorer  .
i 'll know thy thoughts  .
i 'm going to find out what you 're thinking  .
ha  !
what  ?
oh  , misery  !
oh  , what misery  !
dost thou say so  ?
do you really think so  ?
and so she did  .
that 's right  , she did  .
why  , go to then  .
well  , there you go  .
she that  , so young  , could give out such a seeming  , to seel her father 's eyes up close as oak  , he thought 't was witchcraft  .
she was so young  , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft  !
but i am much to blame  .
but i 'm sorry i 've blurted all this out  .
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you  .
i beg your pardon for loving you too much  .
i am bound to thee forever  .
i 'm indebted to you forever  .
i see this hath a little dashed your spirits  .
you seem a little depressed about this  .
not a jot  , not a jot  .
not at all  , not at all  .
trust me  , i fear it has  .
really  , i 'm afraid you are  .
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love  .
i hope you remember that i said all this because i love you  .
but i do see you 're moved  .
but i see you 're troubled  .
i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion  .
please do n't take what i said more seriously than it deserves to be taken  .
i will not  .
i wo n't  .
should you do so  , my lord  , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aimed not at  .
if you take it too seriously  , it 'll have bad effects that i did n't want it to have  .
cassio 's my worthy friend my lord  , i see you 're moved  .
cassio 's a good friend of mine my lord  , i can see you 're upset  .
no  , not much moved  .
no  , not too upset  .
i do not think but desdemona 's honest  .
i 'm sure desdemona would never cheat on me  .
long live she so  .
i hope she never does  !
and long live you to think so  .
and i hope you keep on thinking she would n't  .
and yet how nature  , erring from itself
but still  , it 's true that good things can go bad  , away from their true natures
ay  , there 's the point  .
that 's the point i 'm trying to make  .
as  , to be bold with you  , not to affect many proposd matches of her own clime  , complexion  , and degree  , whereto we see in all things nature tends foh  !
if i can be frank with you  , she veered away from her own nature in turning down all those young men from her own country  , with her skin color  , with her status everything her nature would have drawn her to ugh  !
one may smell in such a will most rank  , foul disproportions  , thoughts unnatural  .
you can almost smell the dark and ugly desires inside her  , the unnatural thoughts but i 'm sorry i did n't mean to refer to her specifically just now  .
but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her  , though i may fear her will  , recoiling to her better judgment  , may fall to match you with her country forms  , and happily repent  .
i only worry that she might snap back to her natural taste in men one day  , and compare you unfavorably to other italians  .
farewell  , farewell  .
goodbye  , goodbye  .
if more thou dost perceive  , let me know more  .
if you see anything else  , let me know  .
set on thy wife to observe  .
tell your wife to watch her  .
leave me  , iago  .
leave me alone now  , iago  .
my lord  , i take my leave  .
my lord  , i 'll say goodbye now  .
why did i marry  ?
why did i ever get married  ?
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more  , much more  , than he unfolds  .
i 'm sure this good and honest man sees and knows more  , much more  , than he 's telling me  .
with any strong or vehement importunity  .
giving it back to him  .
much will be seen in that  .
that will tell you a lot  .
in the meantime  , let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free  , i do beseech your honor  .
but in the meantime  , just assume that i 'm paranoid as i 'm pretty sure i am and keep thinking she 's innocent  , please  .
fear not my government  .
do n't worry about how i handle it  .
i once more take my leave  .
i 'll say goodbye once more  .
if she be false  , heaven mocked itself  .
if she 's cheated on me  , then heaven itself is a fake  .
i 'll not believe 't  .
i do n't believe it  .
how now  , my dear othello  ?
what 's going on  , othello  , darling  ?
your dinner  , and the generous islanders by you invited  , do attend your presence  .
the nobles of cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you  .
i am to blame  .
i 'm sorry  .
why do you speak so faintly  ?
why are you whispering  ?
are you not well  ?
are you sick  ?
i have a pain upon my forehead  , here  .
i have a  , right here in my forehead  .
come  , i 'll go in with you  .
come on  , i 'll escort you to dinner  .
i am very sorry that you are not well  .
i 'm very sorry you 're not feeling well  .
how now  !
what 's going on  ?
what do you here alone  ?
what are you doing here alone  ?
do not you chide  .
do n't snap at me  .
i have a thing for you  .
i 've got something for you  .
a thing for me  ?
you 've got something for me  ?
it is a common thing
it 's a common
ha  ?
what  ?
to have a foolish wife  .
to have a stupid wife  .
oh  , is that all  ?
oh  , is that so  ?
what will you give me now for the same handkerchief  ?
and what would you give me for the handkerchief  ?
what handkerchief  ?
what handkerchief  ?
what handkerchief  ?
what handkerchief  ?
why  , that the moor first gave to desdemona  , that which so often you did bid me steal  .
the one the moor gave to desdemona  , which you asked me to steal so many times  .
hast stolen it from her  ?
you stole it from her  ?
a good wench  , give it me  .
good girl  , give it to me  .
why  , what is that to you  ?
what 's it to you  ?
if it be not for some purpose of import  , give 't me again  .
if you do n't need it for some important reason  , then give it back to me  .
poor lady  , she 'll run mad when she shall lack it  .
poor lady  , she 'll go crazy when she sees it 's missing  .
how now  , my lord  !
what 's with you  , my lord  ?
what sense had i in her stol'n hours of lust  ?
i had no idea she was cheating on me  .
i saw 't not  , thought it not  , it harmed not me  .
i never saw it or suspected it  , so it never hurt me  .
i slept the next night well  , fed well  , was free and merry  .
i slept well  , ate well  , and was happy  .
i found not cassio 's kisses on her lips  .
i never saw cassio 's kisses on her lips  .
he that is robbed  , not wanting what is stol'n  , let him not know't  , and he 's not robbed at all  .
a man who 's robbed  , but does n't miss what 's stolen  , is n't robbed at all  .
i am sorry to hear this  .
i 'm sorry to hear this  .
i had been happy if the general camp  , pioneers and all  , had tasted her sweet body  , so i had nothing known  .
i would 've been happy if the whole army had had sex with her  , the lowest - ranking grunts and all  , as long as i did n't know anything about it  .
oh  , now forever farewell the tranquil mind  !
oh  , goodbye to my peace of mind  !
farewell content  !
goodbye to my happiness  !
farewell the plumd troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue  !
goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great  !
oh  , farewell  !
goodbye  !
farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump  , the spirit - stirring drum  , th ' ear - piercing fife  , the royal banner  , and all quality  , pride  , pomp  , and circumstance of glorious war  !
goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums  , the flute and the splendid banners  , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war  !
and o you mortal engines  , whose rude throats the immortal jove 's dead clamors counterfeit  , farewell  !
and you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods  , goodbye  !
othello 's occupation 's gone  .
othello 's career is over  .
is 't possible  , my lord  ?
is this possible  , my lord  ?
is 't come to this  ?
has it come to this  ?
my noble lord
my noble lord
nay  , stay  .
no  , stop  .
thou shouldst be honest  .
you should always be honest  .
by the world  , i think my wife be honest and think she is not  .
i swear  , i think my wife 's faithful  , and i think she 's not  .
i think that thou art just and think thou art not  .
i think you 're trustworthy one minute and then not the next  .
i 'll have some proof  .
i need proof  !
her name  , that was as fresh as dian 's visage  , is now begrimed and black as mine own face  .
her reputation was as pure as the snow  , but now it 's as dirty and black as my own face  .
if there be cords or knives  , poison  , or fire  , or suffocating streams  , i 'll not endure it  .
as long as there are  , i wo n't stand for this  .
would i were satisfied  !
oh  , how i wish i knew the truth  !
i see  , sir  , you are eaten up with passion  .
i see you 're all eaten up with emotion  .
i do repent me that i put it to you  .
i 'm sorry i said anything  .
you would be satisfied  ?
you want proof  ?
would  ?
want  ?
nay  , and i will  .
yes  , i want it  , and i 'll get it  .
and may  , but how  ?
but how  ?
how satisfied  , my lord  ?
how will you get proof  ?
would you  , the supervisor  , grossly gape on  , behold her topped  ?
are you going to hide and watch them having sex  ?
death and damnation  !
death and damnation  !
oh  !
oh  !
give me a living reason she 's disloyal  .
give me one good reason to think she 's cheating on me  .
oh  , monstrous  !
oh  , that 's monstrous  !
monstrous  !
monstrous  !
nay  , this was but his dream  .
no  , it was just a dream  .
but this denoted a foregone conclusion  .
but it shows that something has already happened  .
't is a shrewd doubt  , though it be but a dream  .
it 's a reason for suspicion  , even though it 's just a dream  .
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly  .
and it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy  .
i 'll tear her all to pieces  !
i 'll tear her to pieces  !
if it be that
if it 's the same one
if it be that  , or any that was hers  , it speaks against her with the other proofs  .
if it 's the same one  , or any one that belongs to her  , then together with the other evidence it 's pretty strong  .
yet be content  .
calm down
oh  , blood  , blood  , blood  !
i want blood  !
patience  , i say  .
be patient  , i 'm telling you  .
your mind may change  .
you may change your mind later  .
never  , iago  .
never  , iago  .
like to the pontic sea  , whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er keeps retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont  , even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back  , ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up  .
my thoughts of revenge are flowing through me like a violent river  , never turning back to love  , only flowing toward full revenge that 'll swallow them up  .
now  , by yon marble heaven  , in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words  .
i swear to god i 'll get revenge  .
do not rise yet  .
do n't get up yet  .
witness  , you ever - burning lights above  , you elements that clip us round about  , witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit  , hands  , heart  , to wronged othello 's service  .
let heaven be my witness i 'm putting my mind  , my heart  , and my hands in othello 's control  .
let him command  , and to obey shall be in me remorse  , what bloody business ever  .
let him command me  , and i 'll do whatever he asks  , no matter how violent  .
damn her  , lewd minx  !
damn her  , the wicked whore  !
oh  , damn her  , damn her  !
oh  , damn her  , damn her  !
come  , go with me apart  .
come away with me  .
i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil  .
i 'm going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil  .
now art thou my lieutenant  .
you 're my lieutenant now  .
i am your own for ever  .
i 'm yours forever  .
do you know  , sirrah  , where lieutenant cassio lies  ?
excuse me  , do you know which room lieutenant cassio  ?
i dare not say he lies anywhere  .
i would n't dare say he lies anywhere  .
why  , man  ?
why do you say that  ?
go to  .
oh  , come on  .
where lodges he  ?
where does he sleep  ?
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie  .
telling you where he 's sleeping is like telling you where i 'm lying  .
can anything be made of this  ?
what on earth does that mean  ?
i know not where he lodges  , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here  , or he lies there  , were to lie in mine own throat  .
i do n't know where he 's staying  , so if i told you he 's sleeping here or there  , i 'd be lying  .
can you inquire him out and be edified by report  ?
can you ask around and find out  ?
i will catechize the world for him  , that is  , make questions  , and by them answer  .
i 'll go ask questions everywhere  .
seek him  , bid him come hither  .
find him and tell him to come here  .
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf  , and hope all will be well  .
tell him i 've spoken to my husband on his behalf  , and i think everything will be all right  .
where should i lose that handkerchief  , emilia  ?
where could i have lost that handkerchief  , emilia  ?
i know not  , madam  .
i do n't know  , madam  .
believe me  , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes  .
believe me  , i 'd rather have lost a purse full of gold coins  .
and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are  , it were enough to put him to ill thinking  .
this would be enough to make my husband suspect me  , if he was n't so free of jealousy  .
is he not jealous  ?
he 's not jealous  ?
who  , he  ?
who  , him  ?
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him  .
i think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land  .
look where he comes  .
look  , here he comes  .
i will not leave him now till cassio be called to him  .
i wo n't leave him alone until he gives cassio his job back  .
how is 't with you  , my lord  ?
how are you  , my lord  ?
well  , my good lady  .
i 'm fine  , my lady  .
oh  , hardness to dissemble  !
oh  , it 's so hard to pretend  !
how do you  , desdemona  ?
how are you  , desdemona  ?
well  , my good lord  .
i 'm fine  , my lord  .
give me your hand  .
give me your  .
this hand is moist  , my lady  .
your hand 's moist  , my lady  .
it hath felt no age nor known no sorrow  .
it 's moist because it 's still young and inexperienced  .
this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart  .
it says you 're fertile  , and you 've got a giving heart  .
hot  , hot  , and moist  .
hot  , hot and moist  .
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty  , fasting  , and prayer  ,
with a hand like this you need to
i can not speak of this  .
i do n't know about that  .
come now  , your promise  .
now  , do n't forget  , you promised me something  .
what promise  , chuck  ?
what did i promise  , my dear  ?
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you  .
i sent for cassio to come talk with you  .
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me  .
i have a bad cold that 's bothering me  .
lend me thy handkerchief  .
lend me your handkerchief  .
here  , my lord  .
here  , my lord  .
that which i gave you  .
no  , the one i gave you  .
i have it not about me  .
i do n't have it with me  .
not  ?
you do n't  ?
no  , indeed  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  .
is 't possible  ?
is that possible  ?
't is true  .
yes  , it 's true  .
there 's magic in the web of it  .
there 's magic in its fabric  .
a sibyl  , that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses  , in her prophetic fury sewed the work  .
a two - hundred - year - old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance  .
the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk  , and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens ' hearts  .
the silk came from sacred silkworms  , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts  .
indeed  ?
really  ?
is 't true  ?
is that true  ?
most veritable  , therefore look to 't well  .
it 's absolutely true  , so take good care of it  .
then would to heaven that i had never seen 't  !
i wish i had never seen it  !
ha  !
ha  !
wherefore  ?
why  ?
why do you speak so startingly and rash  ?
why are you yelling at me so angrily  ?
is 't lost  ?
is it lost  ?
is 't gone  ?
is it gone  ?
speak  , is 't out o ' th ' way  ?
tell me  , is it missing  ?
bless us  !
god help me  !
say you  ?
what do you have to say for yourself  ?
it is not lost  , but what and if it were  ?
it 's not lost  , but what if it were  ?
how  !
what do you mean  ?
i say  , it is not lost  .
i 'm telling you  , it 's not lost  .
fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives  .
bring me the handkerchief my mind is full of doubt  .
the handkerchief  !
the handkerchief  !
the handkerchief  !
the handkerchief  !
in sooth  , you are to blame  .
really  , i do n't think you 're behaving very well  .
away  !
damn it  !
is not this man jealous  ?
and you say he 's not jealous  ?
't is not a year or two shows us a man  .
men are all the same  , but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are  .
they are all but stomachs  , and we all but food  .
they 're like stomachs and we 're just the food  .
to eat us hungerly  , and when they are full  , they belch us  .
they eat us up hungrily  , and when they 're full  , they vomit us up  .
look you  , cassio and my husband  !
look  , here comes cassio and my husband  .
is my lord angry  ?
is othello angry  ?
he went hence but now  , and certainly in strange unquietness  .
he just left  , clearly upset about something  .
i prithee  , do so  .
please  , do so  .
pray heaven it be state matters  , as you think  , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you  .
i hope to god it 's something political  , like you think  , and not jealousy involving you  .
alas the day  !
oh no  !
i never gave him cause  .
i never gave him reason to be jealous  .
but jealous souls will not be answered so  .
but jealous people do n't think like that  .
they are not ever jealous for the cause  , but jealous for they 're jealous  .
they 're never jealous for a reason  ; they 're just jealous  .
it is a monster begot upon itself  , born on itself  .
it 's like a monster that just grows and grows  , out of nothing  .
heaven keep the monster from othello 's mind  !
i hope god keeps that monster from growing in othello 's mind  !
lady  , amen  .
amen to that  , lady  .
i humbly thank your ladyship  .
i thank you  , lady  .
save you  , friend cassio  !
hello  , cassio  !
what make you from home  ?
why are you so far from home  ?
how is 't with you  , my most fair bianca  ?
how are you  , my pretty bianca  ?
indeed  , sweet love  , i was coming to your house  .
to tell you the truth  , i was just going to your house  .
and i was going to your lodging  , cassio  .
and i was just going to yours  .
what  , keep a week away  ?
you 've kept away from me for a week  ?
seven days and nights  ?
seven days and seven nights  ?
eight score eight hours  ?
a hundred and sixty - eight hours  ?
and lovers ' absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times  !
and lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones  !
oh weary reckoning  !
what a tedious wait  !
o cassio  , whence came this  ?
oh  , cassio  , where did you get this  ?
this is some token from a newer friend  !
this is a gift from another woman  , a new lover  !
to the felt absence now i feel a cause  .
now i know why you 've been staying away from me  .
is 't come to this  ?
has it come to this  ?
well  , well  .
well  , well  .
go to  , woman  , throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth from whence you have them  .
oh  , come on  , woman  .
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress  , some remembrance  .
stop jumping to silly conclusions  .
no  , in good troth  , bianca  .
now you 're jealous  , thinking that this is from some mistress of mine  , but i swear it 's not  , bianca  .
why  , whose is it  ?
well  , whose is it  ?
leave you  !
leave you alone  !
wherefore  ?
why  ?
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition  , nor my wish  , to have him see me womaned  .
i 'm waiting here for the general  , and i do n't want him to see me with a woman  .
why  , i pray you  ?
and why 's that  ?
not that i love you not  .
it 's not because i do n't love you  .
but that you do not love me  .
but you do n't love me  .
i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night  .
please  , just walk with me a little ways  , and tell me if i 'll see you later tonight  .
't is but a little way that i can bring you  , for i attend here  .
i can only walk a little way with you  , since i 'm waiting here  .
but i 'll see you soon  .
but i 'll see you soon  .
't is very good  .
all right  , have it your way  .
i must be circumstanced  .
i have to make do  .
will you think so  ?
do you really think so  ?
think so  , iago  ?
what do you mean  , do i think so  ?
what  , to kiss in private  ?
what  , just because they kissed in private  ?
an unauthorized kiss  !
an illicit kiss  !
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more  , not meaning any harm  ?
maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so  , but they did n't do anything  .
so they do nothing  , 't is a venial slip  .
as long as they did n't do anything  , it would only be a minor sin  .
but if i give my wife a handkerchief
but if i gave my wife a handkerchief
what then  ?
then what  ?
she is protectress of her honor too  .
her reputation is also her own  .
may she give that  ?
can she give that away too  ?
by heaven  , i would most gladly have forgot it  .
god  , i wish i could forget about the handkerchief  !
thou saidst oh  , it comes o'er my memory  , as doth the raven o'er the infectious house  , boding to all he had my handkerchief  .
what you told me it haunts me like a nightmare he 's got my handkerchief  !
ay  , what of that  ?
yes  , what about it  ?
that 's not so good now  .
that 's not good  .
hath he said any thing  ?
has he said anything  ?
he hath  , my lord  , but be you well assured no more than he 'll unswear  .
yes  , but he 'd deny it all  .
what hath he said  ?
what did he say  ?
why  , that he did i know not what he did  .
he said he did i do n't know  .
lie
he was in bed with
with her  ?
with her  ?
with her  , on her  , what you will  .
with her  , on top of her however you want to say it  .
how now  , cassio  !
hey  , cassio  !
what 's the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy  .
othello 's having some kind of epileptic fit  .
this is his second fit  .
this is his second fit like this  .
he had one yesterday  .
he had one yesterday  .
rub him about the temples  .
rub his temples  .
he will recover straight  .
better right away  .
when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you  .
when he leaves  , it 's very important that i talk to you  .
how is it  , general  ?
what happened  , general  ?
have you not hurt your head  ?
did you hit your head  ?
dost thou mock me  ?
are you making fun of me  ?
there 's many a beast then in a populous city  , and many a civil monster  .
in that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city  .
did he confess it  ?
did he confess  ?
oh  , thou art wise  !
you 're wise  !
't is certain  .
that 's for sure  .
dost thou hear  , iago  ?
do you hear what i 'm saying  , iago  ?
i will be found most cunning in my patience  , but dost thou hear  ?
i 'll be very patient  , but do you hear me  ?
most bloody  .
i 'm not done with him yet
that 's not amiss  , but yet keep time in all  .
that 's fine  , but for now keep your cool  .
will you withdraw  ?
will you go hide  ?
now will i question cassio of bianca  , a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes  .
now i 'll ask cassio about bianca  , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes  .
it is a creature that dotes on cassio  , as 't is the strumpet 's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one  .
she 's crazy about cassio  .
he  , when he hears of her  , can not refrain from the excess of laughter  .
that 's the whore 's curse  , to seduce many men  , but to be seduced by one  .
here he comes  .
whenever he talks about her he ca n't stop laughing  .
as he shall smile  , othello shall go mad  .
and when he laughs  , othello will go crazy  .
and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio 's smiles  , gestures  , and light behavior quite in the wrong  .
in his ignorant jealousy  , he 'll totally misunderstand cassio 's smiles  , gestures  , and jokes  .
how do you now  , lieutenant  ?
how are you  , lieutenant  ?
ply desdemona well  , and you are sure on 't  .
just keep asking desdemona  , and it 'll be yours  .
now if this suit lay in bianca 's power how quickly should you speed  !
if it was up to bianca to get you your job back  , you 'd have had it already  !
alas  , poor caitiff  !
the poor thing  !
look how he laughs already  !
he 's laughing already  !
i never knew woman love man so  .
i never knew a woman who loved a man so much  .
alas  , poor rogue  , i think indeed she loves me  .
the poor thing  , i really think she loves me  .
now he denies it faintly  , and laughs it out  .
now he denies it a bit  , and tries to laugh it off  .
do you hear  , cassio  ?
have you heard this  , cassio  ?
now he importunes him to tell it o'er  .
he 's asking him to tell the story again  .
go to  , well said  , well said  .
go on  , tell it  .
she gives it out that you shall marry her  .
she says you 're going to marry her  .
do you intend it  ?
are you  ?
ha  , ha  , ha  !
ha  , ha  , ha  !
do ye triumph  , roman  ?
are you laughing because you 've won  ?
do you triumph  ?
do you think you 've won  ?
so  , so  , so  , so  !
so  , so  , so  , so  !
they laugh that win  !
the winner 's always got the last laugh  , has n't he  ?
why the cry goes that you shall marry her  .
i swear  , there 's a rumor going around that you 'll marry her  .
prithee say true  !
you 're kidding  !
i am a very villain else  .
if it 's not true  , you can call me a villain  .
have you scored me  ?
have you given me bastard children to raise  ?
well  .
all right  , then  .
iago beckons me  .
iago is gesturing for me to come closer  .
now he begins the story  .
now he 's telling the story  .
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me  , so shakes  , and pulls me  !
she hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries  , shaking me and pulling at me  .
ha  , ha  , ha  !
ha  , ha  , ha  !
well  , i must leave her company  .
i have to get rid of her  .
how now  , my sweet bianca  !
what is it  , my dear bianca  ?
how now  , how now  ?
what 's wrong  ?
by heaven  , that should be my handkerchief  !
my god  , that 's my handkerchief  !

goats and monkeys  !
horny animals  !
he is much changed  .
he 's changed a great deal  .
are his wits safe  ?
is he sane  ?
is he not light of brain  ?
is he losing his mind  ?
he 's that he is  .
he is what he is  .
i may not breathe my censure what he might be  .
i wo n't say anything negative about what he might be  .
if what he might he is not  , i would to heaven he were  !
if he is n't what he might be  , then i wish to god he were  !
'faith  , that was not so well  .
it 's true  , that was n't such a nice thing to do  .
yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst  !
but i wish i could say that 's the last time he 'll do it  !
is it his use  ?
is it a habit of his  ?
or did the letters work upon his blood and new - create his fault  ?
or did the letter make him emotional somehow  , and this is the first time he 's done it  ?
i am sorry that i am deceived in him  .
i 'm sorry i was so wrong about him  .
you have seen nothing then  ?
you have n't seen anything  , then  ?
nor ever heard  , nor ever did suspect  .
no  , and i did n't hear anything either  , or suspect anything at all  .
yes  , you have seen cassio and she together  .
but you 've seen her and cassio together  .
but then i saw no harm  , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them  .
yes  , but i did n't see anything wrong  , and i heard every syllable they said  .
what  , did they never whisper  ?
did n't they ever whisper  ?
never  , my lord  .
never  , my lord  .
nor send you out o ' th ' way  ?
or ask you to leave the room  ?
never  .
never  .
to fetch her fan  , her gloves  , her mask  , nor nothing  ?
not even to get her fan  , or her gloves  , or her mask  , or anything  ?
never  , my lord  .
no  , my lord  .
that 's strange  .
that 's strange  .
i durst  , my lord  , to wager she is honest  , lay down my soul at stake  .
i 'd swear to you on my soul that she 's a good  , honest person  , sir  .
if you think other remove your thought  , it doth abuse your bosom  .
if you suspect otherwise  , stop thinking that right now because you 're wrong  .
if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent 's curse for if she be not honest  , chaste  , and true there 's no man happy  .
if any jerk has tried to convince you she 's bad  , i hope god curses him  .
the purest of their wives is foul as slander  .
if she 's not honest  , faithful  , and true  , then there 's no such thing as a faithful wife or a happy husband  .
bid her come hither  .
tell her to come here  .
go  .
go  .
she says enough  , yet she 's a simple bawd that can not say as much  .
she says all the right things  , but the dumbest brothel - keeper would tell the same story  .
this is a subtle whore  , a closet  , lock and key  , of villainous secrets  .
desdemona 's a tricky whore with a closet full of awful secrets  , but still she 'll kneel and pray like an honest woman  .
and yet she 'll kneel and pray  , i have seen her do 't  .
i 've seen her do it  .
my lord  , what is your will  ?
my lord  , what do you want  ?
pray  , chuck  , come hither  .
please  , dear  , come here  .
what is your pleasure  ?
what can i do for you  ?
let me see your eyes  .
let me see your eyes  .
look in my face  .
look at my face  .
what horrible fancy 's this  ?
what horrible thing are you imagining  ?
upon my knee  , what doth your speech import  ?
i 'm begging you on my knees to tell me what your words mean  .
i understand a fury in your words  , but not the words  .
i can tell you 're furious  , but i do n't understand what you 're saying  .
come  , swear it  , damn thyself  .
go ahead  , swear to that  , so you 'll be damned to hell for lying  .
lest  , being like one of heaven  , the devils themselves should fear to seize thee  .
otherwise the devils will mistake you for an angel and be too scared to grab you  .
therefore be double damned  , swear thou art honest  !
go ahead  , make sure you damn yourself by swearing you 've been faithful to me  .
heaven doth truly know it  .
heaven knows i am  .
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell  .
heaven knows you 're as unfaithful as hell  .
to whom  , my lord  ?
unfaithful  , my lord  ?
with whom  ?
with whom  ?
how am i false  ?
how am i unfaithful  ?
ah  , desdemona  , away  , away  , away  !
leave me alone  , desdemona  , go away  !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest  .
i hope you think i 'm faithful to you  .
alas  , what ignorant sin have i committed  ?
have i done something to offend you without knowing it  ?
by heaven  , you do me wrong  !
i swear to god you 're accusing me wrongly  !
are you not a strumpet  ?
so you 're saying you 're not a whore  ?
no  , as i am a christian  .
no  , i 'm as honest as i am christian  .
if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet  , i am none  .
if only letting my husband touch my body means i 'm not a whore  , i 'm not a whore  .
what  , not a whore  ?
what  , you 're not a whore  ?
no  , as i shall be saved  .
no  , i swear it  .
is 't possible  ?
is that possible  ?
oh  , heaven forgive us  !
oh  , heaven help us  !
faith  , half asleep  .
i 'm stunned  , to tell you the truth  .
good madam  , what 's the matter with my lord  ?
my lady  , what 's wrong with your husband  ?
with who  ?
with who  ?
who is thy lord  ?
who 's your lord  ?
he that is yours  , sweet lady  .
my lord is your lord  .
here 's a change indeed  !
things have certainly changed  !
't is meet i should be used so  , very meet  .
it 's fair for him to treat me like this  , very fair  .
how have i been behaved that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse  ?
what have i ever done that he has anything to complain about  ?
what is your pleasure  , madam  ?
what can i do for you  , madam  ?
how is 't with you  ?
how are you  ?
i can not tell  .
i do n't know  .
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks  .
when grown - ups teach little children  , they do it gently and easily  .
he might have chid me so  , for  , in good faith  , i am a child to chiding  .
he might have treated me like that  , because i 'm as unused to abuse as a little child  .
what is the matter  , lady  ?
what 's the matter  , lady  ?
alas  , iago  , my lord hath so bewhored her  , thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her  , that true hearts can not bear it  .
he called her a whore so many times  , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people ca n't stand to hear it  .
am i that name  , iago  ?
am i that name  , iago  ?
what name  , fair lady  ?
what name  , madam  ?
such as she says my lord did say i was  .
what my lord said i was  .
he called her whore  .
he called her a whore  .
a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callet  .
a beggar could n't have called his slut worse names  .
why did he so  ?
why did he do that  ?
i do not know  .
i do n't know  .
i am sure i am none such  .
i just know i 'm not one  .
do not weep  , do not weep  .
do n't cry  , do n't cry  .
alas the day  !
what a day this is  !
hath she forsook so many noble matches  , her father and her country  , and her friends  , to be called whore  ?
did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen  , give up her father and country and friends  , just to be called a whore  ?
would it not make one weep  ?
does n't that make you want to cry  ?
it is my wretched fortune  .
it 's just my bad luck  .
beshrew him for 't  !
damn him  !
how comes this trick upon him  ?
how did he get such an idea  ?
nay  , heaven doth know  .
heaven knows  .
i will be hanged  , if some eternal villain  , some busy and insinuating rogue  , some cogging  , cozening slave  , to get some office  , have not devised this slander  .
i bet my life some evil busybody  , some meddling  , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position  .
i will be hanged else  !
i bet my life on it  .
fie  , there is no such man  .
nobody 's that bad  .
it is impossible  .
it 's impossible  .
if any such there be  , heaven pardon him  !
if there is  , then heaven help him  !
speak within door  .
keep your voice down  .
oh  , fie upon them  !
oh  , to hell with those people  !
some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor  .
it 's the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect i 'd cheated on you with the moor  .
you are a fool  .
you 're a fool  .
go to  .
shut up  .
alas iago  , what shall i do to win my lord again  ?
oh god  , iago  , what can i do to win my husband back again  ?
good friend  , go to him  .
please go to him  , my friend  .
for  , by this light of heaven  , i know not how i lost him  .
i swear i have no idea why he stopped loving me  .
here i kneel  : if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love  , either in discourse of thought or actual deed  , or that mine eyes  , mine ears  , or any sense  , delighted them  , or any other form  , or that i do not yet  , and ever did  ,
here i 'm kneeling to swear that if i ever did anything to destroy his love for me  , either by thoughts or actions  , or if i ever took pleasure in anyone else  , or if i never did love him  , or do n't love him now even though he tries to shake me off
if 'twere no other
if only that were all it is
't is but so  , i warrant  .
it is  , i promise  .
hark  , how these instruments summon to supper  .
those trumpets are calling us in to dinner  .
the messengers of venice stays the meat  .
the venetians are waiting for their food  .
go in  , and weep not  .
go in  , and do n't cry  .
all things shall be well  .
everything will be all right  .
how now  , roderigo  !
how are you  , roderigo  ?
i do not find that thou deal'st justly with me  .
i do n't think you 're treating me fairly  .
what in the contrary  ?
what makes you say that  ?
will you hear me  , roderigo  ?
will you listen to me  , roderigo  ?
you charge me most unjustly  .
that 's not fair  .
with naught but truth  .
it 's the truth  .
i have wasted myself out of my means  .
i 've got no money left  .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress  .
the jewels you took from me to deliver to desdemona would 've made even a nun want to sleep with me  .
you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance  , but i find none  .
you told me she got them  , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon  , but nothing like that ever happens  .
well  , go to  .
well  , all right then  .
very well  .
fine  .
very well  .
okay  .
i tell you 't is not very well  .
it 's not okay  !
i will make myself known to desdemona  .
i 'm going to tell desdemona my feelings  .
if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation  .
if she returns my jewels  , i 'll stop pursuing her and apologize to her  .
if not  , assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you  .
if not  , i 'll challenge you to a duel  .
you have said now  .
you 've said what you have to say now  .
ay  , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing  .
yes  , and i 'll do everything i just said  .
it hath not appeared  .
it does n't look that way to me  .
i grant indeed it hath not appeared  , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment  .
i admit it does n't look that way to me  , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you 're smart  .
but  , roderigo  , if thou hast that in thee indeed  , which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose  , courage and valor this night show it  .
but roderigo  , if you 're as courageous and determined as i think you are  , then wait just a bit longer  .
if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona  , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life  .
if you 're not having sex with desdemona tomorrow night  , then i suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me  .
well  , what is it  ?
well  , what 's your plan  ?
is it within reason and compass  ?
is it feasible  ?
sir  , there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello 's place  .
venice has made cassio governor here on cyprus  .
is that true  ?
is that true  ?
why  , then othello and desdemona return again to venice  .
then desdemona and othello will go back to venice  .
how do you mean  , removing of him  ?
what do you mean  , get rid of him  ?
why  , by making him uncapable of othello 's place  : knocking out his brains  .
i mean knock his brains out  , so he ca n't take othello 's place  .
and that you would have me to do  !
and that 's what you want me to do  !
i will hear further reason for this  .
i want to hear more about this  .
i do beseech you  , sir  , trouble yourself no further  .
please  , sir  , do n't trouble yourself  .
oh  , pardon me  , 'twill do me good to walk  .
i beg your pardon  ; walking will make me feel better  .
madam  , good night  .
good night  , madam  .
i humbly thank your ladyship  .
thank you  .
your honor is most welcome  .
you 're most welcome  .
will you walk  , sir  ?
would you walk out with me  , sir  ?
o desdemona
oh  , desdemona
my lord  ?
yes  , my lord  ?
i will  , my lord  .
i will  , my lord  .
how goes it now  ?
how are things now  ?
he looks gentler than he did  .
he looks calmer than he did before  .
dismiss me  ?
send me away  ?
it was his bidding  .
that 's what he said  .
therefore  , good emilia  , give me my nightly wearing  , and adieu  .
so give me my nightgown  , emilia  , and i 'll say goodnight  .
we must not now displease him  .
we should n't displease him  .
ay  .
yes  .
would you had never seen him  !
i wish you 'd never met him  .
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed  .
i put those wedding sheets on your bed  , as you asked  .
all 's one  .
it does n't matter  .
good father  , how foolish are our minds  !
oh  , how silly we are  !
if i do die before thee  , prithee  , shroud me in one of these same sheets  .
if i die before you do make sure i 'm wrapped in those sheets in my coffin  .
come  , come  !
listen to you  !
you talk  !
do n't be silly  !
shall i go fetch your nightgown  ?
should i get your nightgown  ?
no  , unpin me here  .
no  , just help me unpin this  .
this lodovico is a proper man  .
that lodovico is a good - looking man  .
a very handsome man  .
he 's very handsome  .
he speaks well  .
he speaks well  .
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip  .
i know a lady in venice who 'd walk all the way to palestine for a kiss from him  .
it 's the wind  .
it 's the wind  .
't is neither here nor there  .
no  , it does n't mean anything  .
i have heard it said so  .
i heard someone say that 's what it means  .
oh  , these men  , these men  !
oh  , these men  , these men  !
dost thou in conscience think tell me  , emilia that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind  ?
do you honestly think tell me  , emilia there are women who 'd cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner  ?
there be some such  , no question  .
there are women like that out there  , no question  .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world  ?
would you ever do such a thing for all the world  ?
why  , would not you  ?
why  , would n't you  ?
no  , by this heavenly light  !
by the light of heaven  , no  , i would not  !
nor i neither  , by this heavenly light  .
i would n't either  , by daylight  .
i might do 't as well i ' th ' dark  .
it would be easier to do it in the dark  .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world  ?
could you really do such a thing  , for all the world  ?
the world 's a huge thing  .
the world 's huge  .
it is a great price for a small vice  .
it 's a big prize for such a small sin  .
in troth  , i think thou wouldst not  .
i do n't think you would  .
in troth  , i think i should  , and undo 't when i had done  .
actually i think i would  , and then i 'd undo it after i did it  .
marry  , i would not do such a thing for a joint - ring  , nor for measures of lawn  , nor for gowns  , petticoats  , nor caps  , nor any petty exhibition  .
i would n't do it for a nice ring  , or fine linen  , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats  .
but for the whole world  ?
but for the whole world  ?
why  , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch  ?
who would n't cheat on her husband to make him king  ?
i should venture purgatory for 't  .
i 'd risk my soul for that  .
beshrew me  , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world  .
i 'd never do such a bad thing  , not for the whole world  !
why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world  , and having the world for your labor  , 't is a wrong in your own world  , and you might quickly make it right  .
why  , a bad action is just a wrong in this world  , but when you 've won the whole world  , it 's a wrong in your own world  , so you can make it right then  .
i do not think there is any such woman  .
i do n't think any woman like that exists  .
yes  , a dozen  , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for  .
yes  , a dozen of them as many as there are women in the world  , in fact  .
but i do think it is their husbands ' faults if wives do fall  .
but i do think it 's the husband 's fault if we wives cheat on them  .
say that they slack their duties
for instance  , our husbands
good night  , good night  .
good night  , good night  .
heaven me such uses send  , not to pick bad from bad  , but by bad mend  !
i pray that god will let me learn from women like that not to follow their bad example  , but to avoid it  !

i 'll be at thy elbow  .
i 'll be right next to you  .

keep that in mind  , and be steady  .
here  , at thy hand  .
i 'm right behind you  .
be bold  , and take thy stand  .
be bold  , and get ready  .
i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons  .
i do n't really want to do this  , but he 's given me good reasons  .
't is but a man gone  .
i guess it 's only one man no big deal  .
forth  , my sword  : he dies  .
my sword comes out  , and he dies  .
i know his gait  , 't is he  .
i know the sound of his walk  .
villain  , thou diest  !

a guiltless death i die  .
i 'm dying an innocent woman  .
oh  , who hath done this deed  ?
oh  , who did this thing  ?
why  , how should she be murdered  ?
why  , how could she have been murdered  ?
alas  , who knows  ?
my god  , who knows  ?
you heard her say herself it was not i  .
you heard her say it was n't me  .
she said so  .
yes  , she said that  .
i must needs report the truth  .
i must go report what happened  .
she 's like a liar gone to burning hell  .
she was lying even as she was going down to hell  .
't was i that killed her  .
i did kill her  .
oh  , the more angel she  , and you the blacker devil  !
then she was even more an angel  , and you 're an even blacker devil  !
she turned to folly  , and she was a whore  .
she cheated on me  , and she was a whore  .
thou dost belie her  , and thou art a devil  .
you slander her  , you devil  .
she was false as water  .
she was fickle and unfaithful  , like water  .
thou art rash as fire  , to say that she was false  .
you 've lost your mind to accuse her of cheating  .
oh  , she was heavenly true  !

my husband  !
my husband  !
thy husband  .
your husband  .
that she was false to wedlock  ?

if she 'd been faithful to me  , i never would have given her up  , not even if god himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her  .
my husband  ?
my husband  .
ay  , 't was he that told me on her first  .
yes  , he 's the one who first told me about her  .
an honest man he is  , and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds  .

my husband  !
my husband  ?

oh  , my mistress  , a villain has made a mockery of your love  !
my husband say that she was false  !
my husband said she was unfaithful  !
if he say so  , may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day  !
if he said that  , then i hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever  .
he lies to th ' heart  .
he 's lying through his teeth  !
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain  .
she was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that  !
ha  !
ha  !

you 'd better shut up  !
what is the matter  ?

o thou dull moor  !
oh  , you stupid moor  !
that handkerchief thou speak'st of i found by fortune and did give my husband  .
i found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband  .
for often  , with a solemn earnestness more than indeed belonged to such a trifle he begged of me to steal it  .
he 'd begged me to steal it many times  .
villainous whore  !
you evil whore  !
she give it cassio  ?
you think she gave it to cassio  ?
no  , alas  , i found it and i did give 't my husband  .
no  , i found it and gave it to my husband  .
filth  , thou liest  !
you piece of filth  , you 're lying  !
by heaven  , i do not  , i do not  , gentlemen  .
i swear i 'm not lying  .
othello o murderous coxcomb  !
othello oh  , you murderous fool  !
what should such a fool do with so good a wife  ?

he 's gone  , but his wife 's killed  .
he 's gone  , and his wife 's dead  .
't is a notorious villain  .
he 's a wicked  , horrible criminal  .
take you this weapon  , which i have recovered from the moor  .
take the moor 's sword and guard the door from the outside  .
come  , guard the door without  .
kill him rather than let him leave this room  .
let him not pass  , but kill him rather  .
i 'm going after iago  .
i 'll after that same villain  , for 't is a damnd slave  .
he 's a horrid criminal  .
i am not valiant neither  , but ever puny whipster gets my sword  .
i 'm not that strong  , if a puny nobody can grab my sword  .
but why should honor outlive honesty  ?
but why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did  ?
let it go all  .
let it all go  .
if thou attempt it  , it will cost thee dear  .
if you try that  , you 'll pay for it  .
thou hast no weapon  , and perforce must suffer  .
you 've got no weapon  , so you 'll have to suffer  .
look in upon me then and speak with me  , or  , naked as i am  , i will assault thee  .
look in on me  , and talk with me  , or i 'll attack even without a weapon  .
what is the matter  ?
what 's the matter  ?
behold  , i have a weapon  .
look  , i have a weapon  , the best sword a soldier could have  .
a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier 's thigh  .
i 've fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon  .
i have seen the day
but
where is this rash and most unfortunate man  ?
where is that poor rash man  ?
that 's he that was othello  .
you mean the man who used to be othello  ?
here i am  .
here i am  .
where is that viper  ?
where 's that snake  ?
bring the villain forth  .
bring the villain forward  .
wrench his sword from him  .
take his sword away from him  .
i bleed  , sir  , but not killed  .
i 'm bleeding  , but you did n't kill me  .
i am not sorry neither  .
i 'm not sorry  , either  .
i 'd have thee live  , for in my sense 't is happiness to die  .
i want you to live  , since to me  , death is happiness  .
this wretch hath part confessed his villainy  .
this poor guy 's partly confessed his plan  .
did you and he consent in cassio 's death  ?
did you plan cassio 's death with him  ?
ay  .
yes  .
dear general  , i never gave you cause  .
dear general  , i never gave you any reason to hate me  .
i do believe it  , and i ask your pardon  .
i believe you  , and i ask you to forgive me  .
will you  , i pray  , demand that demi - devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body  ?
will you please make this half - devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul  ?
demand me nothing  .
do n't ask me anything  .
what you know  , you know  .
you know what you know  .
from this time forth i never will speak word  .
from this moment on  , i 'll never say another word  .
what  , not to pray  ?
what  , not even to pray  ?
torments will ope your lips  .
torture will make you talk  .
well  , thou dost best  .
well  , do your best  .
oh  , villain  !
oh  , you villain  !
most heathenish and most gross  !
ungodly and monstrous  !
o thou pernicious caitiff  !
oh  , you wicked scoundrel  !
how came you  , cassio  , by that handkerchief that was my wife 's  ?
cassio  , how did you get my wife 's handkerchief  ?
i found it in my chamber  , and he himself confessed but even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire  .
i found it in my room  , and iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes  .
there is besides in roderigo 's letter how he upbraids iago  , that he made him brave me upon the watch  , whereon it came that i was cast  .
also  , in his letter to iago  , roderigo criticizes iago for telling him to get me angry while i was on guard duty  , and get me demoted  .
and even but now he spake  , after long seeming dead iago hurt him  , iago set him on  .
and just now he admitted it  , even though he 'd seemed to be dead for a long while iago tricked him  , iago urged him to do it  .
othello you must forsake this room and go with us  .
othello you 'll have to leave this room and come with us  .
your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus  .
you 're stripped of your power and your command  , and cassio will govern cyprus  .
for this slave  , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long  , it shall be his  .
as for this slave  , iago  , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time  , he 'll have it  .
you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state  .
you 'll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the venetian government  .
come  , bring him away  .
okay  , take him away  .
and say besides that in aleppo once  , where a malignant and a turbaned turk beat a venetian and traduced the state  , i took by the throat the circumcisd dog  , and smote him  , thus  .
down  , and then say also that in aleppo i once saw a turk beating a venetian  , so i grabbed the turk by the throat and hit him like this  .
oh  , bloody period  !
oh  , what a bloody end to all this  !
all that is spoke is marred  .
everything we 've heard is bad  .
desdemona i kissed thee ere i killed thee  .
desdemona i kissed you before i killed you  .
no way but this  , killing myself  , to die upon a kiss  .
now  , killing myself  , i 'm dying while i kiss you again  .
this did i fear  , but thought he had no weapon  , for he was great of heart  .
i was afraid this would happen  , because he was a noble  , brave man  , but i did n't think he had a weapon  .
and therefore  , since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair well - spoken days  , i am determind to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days  .
since i ca n't amuse myself by being a lover  , i 've decided to become a villain  .
plots have i laid  , inductions dangerous  , by drunken prophecies  , libels and dreams  , to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate  , the one against the other  ; and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle  , false  , and treacherous  , this day should clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that g of edward 's heirs the murderer shall be  .
i 've set dangerous plans in motion  , using lies  , drunken prophecies  , and stories about dreams to set my brother clarence and the king against each other  .
dive  , thoughts  , down to my soul  .
if king edward is as honest and fair - minded as i am deceitful and cruel  , then clarence is going to be locked away in prison today because of a prophecy that will murder edward 's children  .
here clarence comes  .
oh  , time to hide what i 'm thinking here comes clarence  .
brother  , good day  .
good afternoon  , brother  .
what means this armd guard that waits upon your grace  ?
why are you surrounded by these armed guards  ?
his majesty  , tend'ring my person 's safety  , hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower  .
his majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  .
because my name is george  .
because my name is george  .
alack  , my lord  , that fault is none of yours  .
that 's not your fault  !
he should  , for that  , commit your godfathers  .
he should imprison the person who named you  , instead  .
o  , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christened in the tower  .
maybe the king is sending you to the tower to have you renamed  .
but what 's the matter  , clarence  ?
but  , really  , what 's going on  , clarence  ?
may i know  ?
can you tell me  ?
why  , this it is when men are ruled by women  .
well  , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women  .
't is not the king that sends you to the tower  .
the king is n't the one sending you to the tower  , clarence  .
my lady grey his wife  , clarence  , 't is she that tempers him to this extremity  .
it 's his wife  , lady grey  , who got him to do this  .
was it not she and that good man of worship  , anthony woodeville  , her brother there  , that made him send lord hastings to the tower  , from whence this present day he is delivered  ?
remember how she and her brother  , anthony woodeville  , made him send lord hastings to the tower  ?
we are not safe  , clarence  .
hastings was just released  .
we are not safe  .
we 're not safe  , clarence  , we 're not safe  .
by heaven  , i think there is no man is secure but the queen 's kindred and night - walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore  .
by god  , i think the only people who safe are the queen 's own relatives and the late - night messengers the king uses to fetch his mistress  , mistress shore  .
heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery  ?
did you hear how lord hastings had to beg the queen to be freed  ?
with this  , my lord  , myself have naught to do  .
i have nothing to do with what you 're talking about  , my lord  .
what one  , my lord  ?
who is that  , my lord  ?
her husband  , knave  .
her husband  , you rascal  .
wouldst thou betray me  ?
are you going to get me in trouble  ?
i do beseech your grace to pardon me  , and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke  .
i beg your to pardon me  , and now please stop talking to clarence  .
we know thy charge  , brakenbury  , and will obey  .
we know you have a job to do  , brakenbury  , and we 'll do what you say  .
we are the queen 's abjects and must obey  .
we are required to serve the queen  , and we must obey her  .
brother  , farewell  .
farewell  , brother  .
i will unto the king  , and whatsoe'er you will employ me in  , were it to call king edward 's widow sister  , i will perform it to enfranchise you  .
i will go to the king and do whatever you want me to  , even if it 's to call my brother 's wife sister  , in order to set you free  .
meantime  , this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine  .
but just so you know  , i am very angry about how our own brother has treated you  , angrier than you can imagine  .
i know it pleaseth neither of us well  .
it does n't make either of us happy  , i know  .
well  , your imprisonment shall not be long  .
well  , your imprisonment wo n't last long  .
i will deliver you or else lie for you  .
i will either get you out  , lying if i have to  , or stay in prison in your place  .
meantime  , have patience  .
in the meantime  , be patient  .
i must perforce  .
i have no choice  .
farewell  .
goodbye  .
good time of day unto my gracious lord  .
good afternoon  , my dear lord  !
as much unto my good lord chamberlain  .
the same to you  , my lord  !
well are you welcome to the open air  .
welcome to the open air again  .
how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment  ?
how did you tolerate prison  ?
with patience  , noble lord  , as prisoners must  .
with patience  , noble lord  , as prisoners must  .
but i shall live  , my lord  , to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment  .
but i will live to thank those who sent me there  .
more pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty  .
it 's a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please  .
what news abroad  ?
what 's the news abroad  ?
no news so bad abroad as this at home  : the king is sickly  , weak and melancholy  , and his physicians fear him mightily  .
no news as bad as the news at home  : the king is sickly  , weak  , and depressed  , and his doctors are very afraid he 's going to die
now  , by saint paul  , that news is bad indeed  .
now  , by george  , that really is terrible news  .
o  , he hath kept an evil diet long  , and overmuch consumed his royal person  .
oh  , the king has abused his body with bad habits for a long time  , and it 's finally taking its toll on him  .
't is very grievous to be thought upon  .
very sad  .
where is he  , in his bed  ?
where is he  , in his bed  ?
he is  .
he is  .
go you before  , and i will follow you  .
you go ahead  , and i will follow you  .
and still  , as you are weary of this weight  , rest you  , whiles i lament king henry 's corse  .
when it gets too heavy  , rest  , and i 'll lament over king henry 's corpse some more  .
stay  , you that bear the corse  , and set it down  .
halt  , corpse bearers  , and put down your load  .
what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds  ?
what wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite  ?
villains  , set down the corse or  , by saint paul  , i 'll make a corse of him that disobeys  .
villains  , set down the corpse  , or i 'll make a corpse of  .
my lord  , stand back and let the coffin pass  .
my lord  , stand back and let the coffin pass  .
sweet saint  , for charity  , be not so curst  .
sweet saint  , for goodness 's sake  , do n't be so angry  .
villain  , thou know'st not law of god nor man  .
villain  , you do n't know the laws of god or of man  .
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity  .
even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity  .
but i know none  , and therefore am no beast  .
if i know nothing about pity  , that must mean i 'm not an animal  .
o  , wonderful  , when devils tell the truth  !
it 's amazing to hear a devil speak the truth  !
more wonderful  , when angels are so angry  .
it 's even stranger when an angel is so angry  .
vouchsafe  , divine perfection of a woman  , of these supposd crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself  .
divine  , perfect woman  , give me a chance to prove in detail that i 'm innocent of the evils you accuse me of  .
vouchsafe  , defused infection of a man  , of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursd self  .
contagious infection of humanity  , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils i know you 've committed  .
fairer than tongue can name thee  , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself  .
you who are beautiful beyond words  , calm down and let me explain myself  .
fouler than heart can think thee  , thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself  .
you who are wicked beyond belief  , the only explanation i 'll accept from you is for you to hang yourself  .
by such despair i should accuse myself  .
such an expression of despair would only prove that i was guilty  .
and by despairing shalt thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself that didst unworthy slaughter upon others  .
maybe  , but if you killed yourself  , it would also show that you felt some guilt for killing others  .
say that i slew them not  .
let 's say i did n't kill them  .
then say they were not slain  .
then you might as well say they 're not dead  .
but dead they are  , and devilish slave  , by thee  .
but they are dead  , and you killed them  , you slave of the devil  .
i did not kill your husband  .
i did not kill your husband  .
why then  , he is alive  .
well  , then he must be alive  .
i was provokd by her sland'rous tongue  , that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders  .
she provoked me with her lying mouth  , accusing me of crimes i did n't commit  .
thou wast provokd by thy bloody mind  , that never dream'st on aught but butcheries  .
no  , what provoked you was your own bloody mind  , which never thinks about anything but butchering  .
didst thou not kill this king  ?
you killed this king  , did n't you  ?
i grant you  .
yes  , i 'll grant you that  .
dost grant me  , hedgehog  ?
you 'll grant me  , you hedgehog  ?
then  , god grant me too thou mayst be damnd for that wicked deed  .
then let god grant me that you 'll be damned for that wicked deed  .
o  , he was gentle  , mild  , and virtuous  .

yes  , and one other place  , if you 'll only let me name it  .
some dungeon  .
some dungeon  .
your bedchamber  .
your bedroom  .
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest  !
there is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are  !
so will it  , madam till i lie with you  .
exactly  , madam  , until i sleep with you  .
i hope so  .
i you 're right  .
thou wast the cause and most accursed effect  .
you 're both those people responsible for both cause and effect  .
if i thought that  , i tell thee  , homicide  , these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks  .
if i believed you  , murderer  , i would take my nails and scratch that beauty right off my cheeks  .
black night o'ershade thy day  , and death thy life  .
then i hope night shadows your day  , and death takes your life  !
i would i were  , to be revenged on thee  .
i wish i were  , so i could deprive you of both day and life  .
it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth thee  .
it 's strange that you want to take revenge on the person who loves you  .
it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revenged on him that killed my husband  .
it 's just and reasonable that i want to take revenge on the person who killed my husband  .
he that bereft thee  , lady  , of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband  .
the man who killed your husband  , dear lady  , only did it to help you get a better husband  .
his better doth not breathe upon the earth  .
there is no better one on earth  .
name him  .
name him  .
plantagenet  .
plantagenet  .
why  , that was he  .
yes  , that 's my husband 's name  .
the selfsame name  , but one of better nature  .
someone else has the same name  , but he 's a better man  .
where is he  ?
where is this man  ?
here  .
here  .
why dost thou spit at me  ?
why do you spit at me  ?
would it were mortal poison for thy sake  .
if only i could spit poison  .
never came poison from so sweet a place  .
poison never came from such a sweet place  .
never hung poison on a fouler toad  .
poison never landed on such an ugly toad  .
out of my sight  !

thine eyes  , sweet lady  , have infected mine  .
your beautiful eyes  , sweet lady  , have infected mine with love  .

i wish my eyes were  , so they could strike you dead  !
take up the sword again  , or take up me  .
take up the sword again  , or take me up  .
arise  , dissembler  .
get up  , liar  .
though i wish thy death  , i will not be the executioner  .
though i wish you were dead  , i 'm not going to be the one to kill you  .
then bid me kill myself  , and i will do it  .
then tell me to kill myself  , and i will  .
i have already  .
i have already  .
that was in thy rage  .
you said it when you were furious  .
speak it again and  , even with the word  , this hand  , which for thy love did kill thy love  , shall for thy love kill a far truer love  .
say it again just one word  , and my hand  , which killed your lover out of love  , will kill your far truer lover  .
to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory  .
you will be an accessory to both crimes  .
i would i knew thy heart  .
i wish i knew what was in your heart  .
't is figured in my tongue  .
i 've told you  .
i fear me both are false  .
i fear that your words and your heart are both false  .
then never man was man true  .
then no man has ever been honest  .
well  , well  , put up your sword  .
well  , then  , put your sword away  .
say then my peace is made  .
tell me that you 'll accept my love  .
that shall you know hereafter  .
you 'll know about that later  .
but shall i live in hope  ?
but can i have some hope  ?
all men i hope live so  .
i 'd like to think all men have some hope  .
vouchsafe to wear this ring  .
please wear this ring  .
to take is not to give  .
i 'll take the ring  , but do n't assume i 'm giving you anything in return  .

bid me farewell  .
say goodbye to me  .
sirs  , take up the corse  .
sirs  , take up the corpse  .

there attend my coming  .

and will she yet abase her eyes on me  , that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed  ?
and yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me  , who cut her sweet prince 's life short and made her a widow  ?
on me  , whose all not equals edward 's moiety  ?
on me  , though i am barely half the man that edward was  ?
on me  , that halts and am misshapen thus  ?
on me  , though i am limping and deformed  ?
my dukedom to a beggarly denier  , i do mistake my person all this while  !
i bet i 've been wrong about myself all this time  .
upon my life  , she finds  , although i can not  , myself to be a marv'lous proper man  .
even though i do n't see it  , this lady thinks i 'm a marvelously good - looking man  .
i 'll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body  .
time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions  .
since i am crept in favor with myself  , i will maintain it with some little cost  .
since i 'm suddenly all the rage  , it will be worth the cost  .
but first i 'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love  .

the heavens have blessed you with a goodly son to be your comforter when he is gone  .

queen elizabeth good time of day unto your royal grace  .
queen elizabeth good afternoon  , your royal highness  !
god make your majesty joyful  , as you have been  .
i hope god makes you happy again  , like you once were  .
i do beseech you either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers  , or if she be accused in true report  , bear with her weakness  , which i think proceeds from wayward sickness and no grounded malice  .
please do n't believe the false rumors you 've heard about her feelings toward you  , or if they 're true  , then forgive her  , since she 's only acting that way because she 's sick  , not because she hates you  .
saw you the king today  , my lord of derby  ?
did you see the king today  , lord derby  ?
but now the duke of buckingham and i are come from visiting his majesty  .

would all were well but that will never be  .
i wish i could believe you that all was well  !
i fear our happiness is at the height  .
but i 'm worried that things can only go downhill from here  .
they do me wrong  , and i will not endure it  !
they 're out to get me  , and i wo n't stand for it  !
who is it that complains unto the king that i  , forsooth  , am stern and love them not  ?
which of you has been complaining to the king that i do n't like them  ?
by holy paul  , they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors  .
by god  , whoever is worrying the king with these lies does n't love him very much  .
because i can not flatter and look fair  , smile in men 's faces  , smooth  , deceive and cog  , duck with french nods and apish courtesy  , i must be held a rancorous enemy  .
just because i do n't know how to flatter and act nice  , to smile in men 's faces and  , as soon as their backs are turned  , spread rumors about them  , to bow and scrape like a nobleman trained in the french court  , people have to think i 'm their enemy  .
can not a plain man live and think no harm  , but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken  , sly  , insinuating jacks  ?
ca n't a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick  , sneaky lowlifes  ?
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace  ?
which of us are you referring to  ?
i can not tell  .
i ca n't tell what 's going on  .
the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch  .
the world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost  .
since every jack became a gentleman  , there 's many a gentle person made a jack  .
since every peasant has been made into a nobleman  , many noblemen have been dragged down to the level of peasants  .

god grant we never may have need of you  .
let 's hope we never need your help for anything  .
meantime god grants that we have need of you  .
meanwhile  , we 're the ones who need you  .
our brother is imprisoned by your means  , myself disgraced  , and the nobility held in contempt  , while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble  .
my brother is imprisoned because of you  , i am disgraced  , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago were n't worth a dime have suddenly been promoted  .
you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings ' late imprisonment  .

she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein  , and lay those honors on your high desert  .
she may help you to get many nice promotions  , and then deny she helped you  , claiming you won them on your own merits  .

my lord of gloucester  , i have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long  .
by heaven  , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured  .
by god  , i will tell the king about these taunts  .
i had rather be a country servant - maid than a great queen with this condition  , to be so baited  , scorned  , and stormd at  .
i would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant i could escape your scorn and constant harassment  .
small joy have i in being england 's queen  .
i 've had very little joy as england 's queen  .
and lessened be that small  , god i beseech him  !
god  , give her even less joy  , i beg you  !
thy honor  , state  , and seat is due to me  .
elizabeth  , your honor  , your high rank  , and your position as are all owed to me  .
queen elizabeth ere you were queen  , ay  , or your husband king  , i was a packhorse in his great affairs  , a weeder - out of his proud adversaries  , a liberal rewarder of his friends  .
queen elizabeth before you were queen in fact  , before your husband was king i was a packhorse for his great affairs  , a weeder - out of his proud enemies  , a generous rewarder of his friends  .
to royalize his blood  , i spent mine own  .
in order to make his blood royal  , i spent my own blood  .
ay  , and much better blood than his or thine  .
yes  , and you spent blood than his or your own  .
a murd'rous villain  , and so still thou art  .

there thy kingdom is  .
hell is where your kingdom is  .
my lord of gloucester  , in those busy days which here you urge to prove us enemies  , we followed then our lord  , our sovereign king  .
my lord of gloucester  , in those busy days  , which you 're bringing up now to prove we 're your enemies  , we followed the lawful king  .
so should we you  , if you should be our king  .
if you were king  , we would do the same  .
if i should be  ?
if i were king  ?
i had rather be a peddler  .
i 'd rather be a peddler  .
far be it from my heart  , the thought thereof  .
the thought of being king does n't appeal to me in the least  .
as little joy enjoys the queen thereof  , for i am she  , and altogether joyless  .
no pleasure for the queen  , indeed  : i am the real queen  , and the experience is completely joyless  .
i can no longer hold me patient  .
i can no longer hold my tongue  .
foul  , wrinkled witch  , what mak'st thou in my sight  ?
ugly  , wrinkled witch  , what are you doing here  ?

meseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london  , to be crowned our king  .
i think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from wales and bring him to london to be crowned our king  .
why with some little train  , my lord of buckingham  ?
why only a few courtiers  , my lord of buckingham  ?
and so say i  .
i think so too  .
my lord  , whoever journeys to the prince  , for god 's sake let not us two at home  .
for god 's sake  , my lord  , let 's be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince  .
for by the way i 'll sort occasion  , as index to the story we late talked of  , to part the queen 's proud kindred from the prince  .
along the way  , i 'll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen 's proud relatives  , as step one in the plan we 've discussed  .
good morrow  , neighbor  , whither away so fast  ?
good morrow  , neighbor  , whither away so fast  ?
i promise you i scarcely know myself  .
i 'm telling you  , i hardly know myself  .
hear you the news abroad  ?
did you hear the news that 's going around  ?
yes  , that the king is dead  .
yes  , that the king is dead  .
ill news  , by 'r lady  .
bad news  , by god  .
seldom comes the better  .
the news is always bad  .
i fear  , i fear  , 'twill prove a giddy world  .
but this news is bound to make the world go mad  .
neighbors  , god speed  .
neighbors  , hello  .
give you good morrow  , sir  .
good day to you  , sir  .
doth this news hold of good king edward 's death  ?
is it true that good king edward has died  ?
ay  , sir  , it is too true  , god help the while  .
yes  , sir  , it 's all too true  , god help us  .
then  , masters  , look to see a troublous world  .
then  , gentlemen  , we can count on trouble  .
no  , no  , by god 's good grace  , his son shall reign  .
no  , no  , with god 's help  , his son will be king  .
woe to the land that 's governed by a child  .
it 's bad news when a country is ruled by a child  .
so stood the state when henry the sixth was crowned in paris but at nine months old  .
that 's how it was with henry the sixth  , who was crowned in paris when he was only nine months old  .
why  , so hath this  , both by the father and mother  .
well  , this king has uncles too  , on both his father and mother 's side  .
come  , come  , we fear the worst  .
come  , come  , we 're worrying about the worst - case scenario  .
all will be well  .
i 'm sure everything will be fine  .
truly  , the hearts of men are full of fear  .
it 's true  , people are really worried  .
ye can not reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and full of dread  .
it 's hard to find a person who is n't  .
before the days of change  , still is it so  .
it 's always like this in times of change  .
by a divine instinct  , men 's minds mistrust ensuing dangers  , as by proof we see the water swell before a boist'rous storm  .
by some sort of deep instinct  , we always know when danger is approaching  , just as we know that a storm is coming when the sea swells  .
but leave it all to god  .
but leave it all to god  .
whither away  ?
where are you all off to  ?
marry  , we were sent for to the justices  .
the court has sent for us  .
and so was i .
for me  , too  .
i 'll bear you company  .
i 'll go with you  .
i long with all my heart to see the prince  .
i 'm dying to see the prince  .
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him  .
i hope he 's grown a lot since i last saw him  .
ay  , mother  , but i would not have it so  .
yes  , mother  , but i wish i had n't  .
why  , my young cousin  ?
why  , dear child  ?
it is good to grow  .
it 's good to grow  .
good faith  , good faith  , the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee  !
well  , it certainly was n't true for richard  !
he was the wretched'st thing when he was young  , so long a - growing and so leisurely  , that if this rule were true  , he should be gracious  .
as a child  , he took such a long time to grow up that  , according to his rule  , he should have grown up into a gracious adult  .
and so no doubt he is  , my gracious madam  .
and no doubt he is  , gracious madam  .
i hope he is  , but yet let mothers doubt  .
i hope he is  , but mothers get to have their doubts  .
now  , by my troth  , if i had been remembered  , i could have given my uncle 's grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touched mine  .
hey  , if i 'd remembered something about him  , i could have had a good comeback for my uncle  , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine  .
how  , my pretty york  ?
what would you have said  , my young york  ?
i prithee let me hear it  .
do tell  .
marry  , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old  .
indeed  , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old  .
't was full two years ere i could get a tooth  .
it took me two years before i had a single tooth  .
grandam  , this would have been a biting jest  .
grandmother  , this would have been a biting joke  .
i prithee  , pretty york  , who told thee this  ?
pretty york  , who told you about his teeth  ?
grandam  , his nurse  .
his nurse  , grandmother  .
his nurse  ?
his nurse  ?
why  , she was dead ere thou wast born  .
why  , she was dead before you were even born  .
if 'twere not she  , i can not tell who told me  .
well  , if it was n't her  , i do n't know  .
a parlous boy  !
a mischievous child  .
go to  , you are too shrewd  .
come  , come  , you are too clever for your own good  .
good madam  , be not angry with the child  .
good lady  , do n't be angry with the child  .

such news  , my lord  , as grieves me to report  .
my lord  , it 's news i wish i did n't have to report  .
how doth the prince  ?
how 's the prince  ?

he 's fine and healthy  , madam  .

lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret  , and  , with them  , sir thomas vaughan  , prisoners  .
lord rivers and lord grey have been imprisoned in so has sir thomas vaughan  .
who hath committed them  ?
who sent them there  ?
the mighty dukes  , gloucester and buckingham  .
the powerful dukes gloucester and buckingham  .
for what offence  ?
what did they do wrong  ?
the sum of all i can  , i have disclosed  .
i 've told you everything i know  .
why  , or for what  , the nobles were committed is all unknown to me  , my gracious lord  .
why the nobles were imprisoned  , and on what charges  , i do n't know  , my gracious lord  .
stay  , i will go with you
wait  , i 'll go with you  .
you have no cause  .
you have no reason to  .
welcome  , sweet prince  , to london  , to your chamber  .
welcome  , sweet prince  , to london  , the capital of the king  .
prince welcome  , dear cousin  , my thoughts ' sovereign  .
welcome  , dear nephew  , king of all my thoughts  .
the weary way hath made you melancholy  .
the tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy  .
no  , uncle  , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious  , wearisome  , and heavy  .
it was n't the journey itself  , uncle  , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull  .
i want more uncles here to welcome me  .
i want more uncles here to welcome me  .
god keep me from false friends  , but they were none  .
god should keep me from false friends  , but they were n't false  .
my lord  , the mayor of london comes to greet you  .
my lord  , the mayor of london is here to greet you  .
god bless your grace with health and happy days  .

i thank you  , good my lord  , and thank you all  .
thank you  , my good lord  , thank you all  .
i thought my mother and my brother york would long ere this have met us on the way  .
i thought my mother and my brother  , york  , would have met us on our way here long before now  .
fie  , what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no  !
and what a slug hastings is that he has n't even arrived to tell us whether they 're coming  !
and in good time here comes the sweating lord  .
and  , just in time  , here comes the sweaty lord  .
welcome  , my lord  .
welcome  , my lord  .
what  , will our mother come  ?
what  , is n't my mother coming  ?
on what occasion god he knows  , not i  , the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary  .
god knows why  , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in westminster abbey  .
the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace  , but by his mother was perforce withheld  .
your sweet brother wanted to come meet you  , but his mother would n't let him  .
fie  , what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers  !
damn  , what a sneaky and spiteful course your mother is taking  !
lord cardinal  , will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently  ?
lord cardinal  , will you please persuade the queen to hurry and send the duke of york here  ?
if she deny  , lord hastings  , go with him  , and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce  .
go with him  , lord hastings  , and if she refuses  , take the boy from her by force  .
you are too senseless obstinate  , my lord  , too ceremonious and traditional  .
you are too inexplicably stubborn  , my lord  , too stuck on ceremony  .
weigh it but with the grossness of this age  , you break not sanctuary in seizing him  .
in these less dainty times  , you 're not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him  .
the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place  .
it 's only a sanctuary for those who really need protection or those who are smart enough to claim they do  .
this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore  , in mine opinion  , can not have it  .
the prince has done neither  ; therefore  , in my opinion  , he is n't really protected by sanctuary  .
then taking him from thence that is not there  , you break no privilege nor charter there  .
you 're not breaking any holy laws to take him away  .
oft have i heard of sanctuary men  , but sanctuary children  , ne'er till now  .
often i have heard of sanctuary men  , but until now i 've never heard of sanctuary children  .
my lord  , you shall o'errule my mind for once  .
my lord  , you 've won me over this time  .
come on  , lord hastings  , will you go with me  ?
lord hastings  , will you go with me  ?
i go  , my lord  .
i 'm coming  , my lord  .
good lords  , make all the speedy haste you may  .
go as fast as you can  .
say  , uncle gloucester  , if our brother come  , where shall we sojourn till our coronation  ?
say  , uncle richard  , if my brother comes  , where will i stay till my coronation  ?
i do not like the tower  , of any place  .
of all places  , i do n't like the  .
did julius caesar build that place  , my lord  ?
did n't julius caesar build it  , my lord  ?
he did  , my gracious lord  , begin that place  , which  , since  , succeeding ages have re - edified  .
he started it  , my noble lord  , and succeeding generations rebuilt it  .
is it upon record  , or else reported successively from age to age  , he built it  ?
is it on record that he built it  , or is it just word of mouth  ?
upon record  , my gracious lord  .
on record  , my gracious lord  .
but say  , my lord  , it were not registered  , methinks the truth should live from age to age  , as 'twere retailed to all posterity  , even to the general all - ending day  .
well  , i think that even if it were n't on record  , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next all the way to doomsday  .
so wise so young  , they say  , do never live long  .
as the saying goes  , those that are this wise when they 're this young wo n't live long  .
what say you  , uncle  ?
what did you say  , uncle  ?
i say  , without characters fame lives long  .
i said  , when there are no written records  , a person 's fame lasts for a long time  .
thus  , like the formal vice  , iniquity  , i moralize two meanings in one word  .
like  , i get two meanings out of one word  .
that julius caesar was a famous man  .
that julius caesar was a famous man  .
with what his valor did enrich his wit  , his wit set down to make his valor live  .
his courage helped his cleverness  , and his cleverness made sure that his reputation for being courageous outlived him  .
death makes no conquest of this conqueror  , for now he lives in fame  , though not in life  .
death did n't conquer conqueror  , for he lives on in his fame  , even though he 's dead  .
i 'll tell you what  , my cousin buckingham
i 'll tell you what  , my cousin buckingham
what  , my gracious lord  ?
what  , my dear lord  ?
an if i live until i be a man  , i 'll win our ancient right in france again or die a soldier  , as i lived a king  .
if i live to be a man  , i 'll win again or die a soldier  , as honorably as i lived as a king  .
now in good time here comes the duke of york  .
making good time  , here 's the duke of york  .
richard of york  , how fares our loving brother  ?
richard of york  , how are you doing  , my loving brother  ?
well  , my dread lord so must i call you now  .
very well  , my supreme lord that 's what i have to call you now  .
ay  , brother  , to our grief  , as it is yours  .
yes  , brother  , i feel bad about that  , too  .
too late he died that might have kept that title  , which by his death hath lost much majesty  .
the man who might have kept that title died too soon  , and now it is n't worth nearly as much  .
how fares our cousin  , noble lord of york  ?
how 's my nephew doing  , noble lord of york  ?
i thank you  , gentle uncle  .
thank you for asking  , uncle  .
o  , my lord  , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth  .
oh  , my lord  , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast  .
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far  .
the prince has far outgrown me  .
he hath  , my lord  .
he has  , my lord  .
and therefore is he idle  ?
does that mean he 's lazy  ?
o  , my fair cousin  , i must not say so  .
oh  , my handsome nephew  , i must not say that  .
then is he more beholding to you than i  .
in that case  , he 's more obliged to you than i am  .
he may command me as my sovereign  , but you have power in me as in a kinsman  .
he may command me as my king  , but you still have power over me as a relative  .
i pray you  , uncle  , give me this dagger  .
uncle  , please give me your dagger  .
my dagger  , little cousin  ?
my dagger  , little nephew  ?
with all my heart  .
with all my heart  .
a beggar  , brother  ?
are you begging  , brother  ?
of my kind uncle  , that i know will give  , and being but a toy  , which is no grief to give  .
from my kind uncle  , who i know will give it to me  , especially as it 's not worth much  .
a greater gift than that i 'll give my cousin  .
i 'll give you a greater gift than that  , nephew  .
a greater gift  ?
a greater gift  ?
o  , that 's the sword to it  .
that must mean a sword  .
ay  , gentle cousin  , were it light enough  .
yes  , gentle cousin  , if it were light enough for you  .
o  , then i see you will part but with light gifts  .
oh  , i see  , you will only part with lightweight presents  .
in weightier things you 'll say a beggar nay  .
for more important things  , you 'll say no  .
it is too heavy for your grace to wear  .
a sword 's too heavy for you to wear  .
i weigh it lightly  , were it heavier  .
i would n't think much of it even if it were heavier  .
what  , would you have my weapon  , little lord  ?
what  , do you want to wear weapon  , little lord  ?
i would  , that i might thank you as you call me  .
i do  , so i can thank you for what you called me  .
how  ?
what 's that  ?
little  .
little  .
my lord of york will still be cross in talk  .
the lord of york is always a bit perverse in his chatter  .
uncle  , your grace knows how to bear with him  .
but  , uncle  , you know how to bear with him  .
you mean  , to bear me  , not to bear with me  .
you mean  , to bear me  , not to bear me  .
uncle  , my brother mocks both you and me  .
uncle  , my brother makes fun of both of us  .
because that i am little  , like an ape  , he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders  .
because i 'm little  , like an  , he thinks you should bear me on your shoulders  , like a fool  .
with what a sharp - provided wit he reasons  !
what a sharp mind this boy has  !
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle  , he prettily and aptly taunts himself  .
to make up for his scorn toward his uncle  , he makes fun of himself as well  .
so cunning and so young is wonderful  .
it 's amazing that he 's so cunning at his age  .
prince my lord  , will 't please you pass along  ?
prince my lord  , will you please continue on your way to the tower  ?
myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother  , to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you  .
my good cousin buckingham and i will go to your mother and ask her to meet you there  .
prince what  , will you go unto the tower  , my lord  ?
prince what  , you 're going to the tower  , my lord  ?
my lord protector needs will have it so  .
my protector  , richard  , insists on it  .
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower  .
i ca n't sleep quietly in the tower  .
why  , what should you fear  ?
why  , what are you afraid of  ?
marry  , my uncle clarence ' angry ghost  .
my uncle clarence 's angry ghost  .
my grandam told me he was murdered there  .
my grandmother told me he was murdered there  .
i fear no uncles dead  .
i 'm not afraid of dead uncles  .
nor none that live  , i hope  .
nor living ones  , i hope  .
an if they live  , i hope i need not fear  .
well  , i hope not  .
york but come  , my lord  .
york but come  , my lord  .
with a heavy heart  , thinking on them  , go i unto the tower  .
with a heavy heart  , thinking about my dead uncles  , i will go to the tower  .
think you  , my lord  , this little prating york was not incensd by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously  ?
richard  , do n't you think this chattering little york was encouraged to taunt you by his sneaky mother in that outrageous way  ?
no doubt  , no doubt  .
no doubt  , no doubt  .
o  , 't is a parlous boy  , bold  , quick  , ingenious  , forward  , capable  .
oh  , he 's a dangerously clever boy bold  , quick - witted  , capable  .
he is all the mother 's  , from the top to toe  .
he 's his mother 's child from head to toe  .
he  , for his father 's sake  , so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him  .
hastings loved the prince 's father so much that we wo n't be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince  .
what think'st thou then of stanley  ?
what about stanley  ?
will not he  ?
wo n't he join us  ?

you 'll find us both at crosby place  .
now  , my lord  , what shall we do  , if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots  ?
now  , my lord  , what are we going to do if we find that lord hastings wo n't go along with our plans  ?
chop off his head  .
chop off his head  .
something we will determine  .
whatever we decide to do  .
and look when i am king  , claim thou of me the earldom of hereford  , and all the moveables whereof the king my brother was possessed  .
and when i 'm king  , remember to ask me for the earldom of hereford and all the possessions that go with it  , which my brother the king used to own  .
i 'll claim that promise at your grace 's hands  .
i look forward to that present  .
and look to have it yielded with all kindness  .
you 'll find i 'll give it to you very willingly  .
come  , let us sup betimes  , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form  .

first  , he sends his regards  .

and then  ?
i 'll go  , my lord  , and tell him what you say  .

ay  , my good lord  .
yes  , my good lord  .
i 'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i 'll see the crown so foul misplaced  .
i 'll have my head cut from my shoulders before i 'll see the crown so misplaced  .
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it  ?
but do you think that 's what he 's aiming for  ?
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind  .
well  , let 's hope you stay in that noble frame of mind  .
't is a vile thing to die  , my gracious lord  , when men are unprepared and look not for it  .
it 's a horrible thing to die when you 're not prepared for it  , my gracious lord  .
i know they do  , and i have well deserved it  .

my lord  , good morrow  .
my lord  , good morning  .

good morning  , catesby  .
you may jest on  , but  , by the holy rood  , i do not like these several councils  , i  .
go ahead and laugh at me  , but by jesus  , i do n't like these separate meetings i really do n't  .
my lord  , i hold my life as dear as you do yours  , and never in my days  , i do protest  , was it so precious to me as 't is now  .
my lord  , my life is as important to me as yours is to you  , and it was never as precious to me as it is now  .
think you but that i know our state secure  , i would be so triumphant as i am  ?
do you think i would be feeling as triumphant as i am if i did n't know that our situation was secure  ?
they  , for their truth  , might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats  .
they deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions  .
but come  , my lord  , let 's away  .
but come  , my lord  , let 's go  .
go on before  .
go on ahead  .
i 'll talk with this good fellow  .
i 'll talk with this good man  .
how now  , sirrah  !
what 's up  , man  ?
how goes the world with thee  ?
how 's it going  ?
the better that your lordship please to ask  .
better  , since your lordship was nice enough to ask  .
i tell thee  , man  , 't is better with me now than when thou met'st me last where now we meet  .
i tell you  , man  , it 's better for me  , too  , than the last time we met here  .
then was i going prisoner to the towerby the suggestion of the queen 's allies  .
then i was on my way to the tower  , where i was going to be locked up thanks to the false charges of the queen 's allies  .
but now  , i tell thee keep it to thyself this day those enemies are put to death  , and i in better state than e'er i was  .
but now  , i tell you keep it to yourself  , though those enemies of mine are being put to death today  , and i 'm better than i 've ever been  .

by next week  , i 'll be able to pay you  .

when i ran into this holy man  , those men you mentioned did come to mind  , in fact  .
what  , go you toward the tower  ?
are you headed to the tower  ?
nay  , like enough  , for i stay dinner there  .

what do you say  , your highness  , about my just request  ?
i do remember me  , henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king  , when richmond was a little peevish boy  .

many a morning hath he there been seen  , with tears augmenting the fresh morning 's dew  , adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs  .
he 's been seen there many mornings  , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs  .
but all so soon as the all - cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora 's bed  , away from light steals home my heavy son  ,
but as soon as the sun rises in the east  , my sad son comes home to escape the light  .
and private in his chamber pens himself  , shuts up his windows  , locks fair daylight out  , and makes himself an artificial night  .
he locks himself up alone in his bedroom  , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight  , and makes himself an artificial night  .
black and portentous must this humor prove unless good counsel may the cause remove  .
this mood of his is going to bring bad news  , unless someone smart can fix what 's bothering him  .
my noble uncle  , do you know the cause  ?
my noble uncle  , do you know why he acts this way  ?
i neither know it nor can learn of him  .
i do n't know  , and he wo n't tell me  .
have you importuned him by any means  ?
have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason  ?
both by myself and many other friends  .
i 've tried  , and many of our friends have tried to make him talk  , but he keeps his thoughts to himself  .
but he  , his own affections ' counselor  , is to himself i will not say how true  , but to himself so secret and so close  , so far from sounding and discovery  , as is the bud bit with an envious worm  , ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  , or dedicate his beauty to the same  .
he does n't want any friend but himself  , and though i do n't know whether he 's a friend to himself  , he certainly keeps his own secrets  .
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow  .
he 's like a flower bud that wo n't open itself up to the world because it 's been poisoned from within by parasites  .
we would as willingly give cure as know  .
if we could only find out why he 's sad  , we 'd be as eager to help him as we were to learn the reason for his sadness  .
see  , where he comes  .
look here he comes  .
so please you  , step aside  .
if you do n't mind  , please step aside  .
i 'll know his grievance or be much denied  .
he 'll either have to tell me what 's wrong or else tell me no over and over  .
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift  .

but tell me seriously who it is  .
a sick man in sadness makes his will  , a word ill urged to one that is so ill .
you would n't tell a sick man he seriously has to make his will it would just make him worse  .
in sadness  , cousin  , i do love a woman  .
seriously  , cousin  , i love a woman  .
i aimed so near when i supposed you loved  .
i guessed that already when i guessed you were in love  .

a right fair mark  , fair coz  , is soonest hit  .
a beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest  .
well  , in that hit you miss  .

she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow  .
she refuses to be hit by arrow  .
she hath dian 's wit  .
she 's as clever as diana  , and shielded by the armor of chastity  .
and  , in strong proof of chastity well armed from love 's weak childish bow  , she lives uncharmed  .
she ca n't be touched by the weak and childish arrows of love  .
she will not stay the siege of loving terms  , nor bide th ' encounter of assailing eyes  , nor ope her lap to saint - seducing gold  .
she wo n't listen to words of love  , or let you look at her with loving eyes  , or open her lap to receive gifts of gold  .
oh  , she is rich in beauty  , only poor that when she dies  , with beauty dies her store  .
she 's rich in beauty  , but she 's also poor  , because when she dies her beauty will be destroyed with her  .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste  ?
so she 's made a vow to be a virgin forever  ?
be ruled by me  .
take my advice  .
forget to think of her  .
do n't think about her  .
o  , teach me how i should forget to think  !
teach me to forget to think  !
by giving liberty unto thine eyes  .
do it by letting your eyes wander freely  .
examine other beauties  .
look at other beautiful girls  .
i 'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt  .
i 'll show you how to forget  , or else i 'll die owing you that lesson  .
but montague is bound as well as i  , in penalty alike  .
but montague has sworn an oath just like i have  , and he 's under the same penalty  .
and 't is not hard  , i think  , for men so old as we to keep the peace  .
i do n't think it will be hard for men as old as we are to keep the peace  .
but saying o'er what i have said before  .
i can only repeat what i 've said before  .
my child is yet a stranger in the world  .
my daughter is still very young  .
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years  .
she 's not even fourteen years old  .
let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride  .
let 's wait two more summers before we start thinking she 's ready to get married  .
younger than she are happy mothers made  .

hence will i to my ghostly friar 's close cell  , his help to crave and my dear hap to tell  .
now i 'll go see my priest  , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck  .
and where the worser is predominant  , full soon the canker death eats up that plant  .
when evil is dominant  , death soon kills the body like cancer  .
good morrow  , father  .
good morning  , father  .
benedicite  .
god bless you  .
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me  ?
who greets me so early in the morning  ?
young son  , it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed  .
young man  , something 's wrong if you 're getting out of bed this early  .
care keeps his watch in every old man 's eye  , and where care lodges  , sleep will never lie  .
every old man has worries  , and worried men never get any sleep  , but young men should n't have a care in the world  .
but where unbruisd youth with unstuffed brain doth couch his limbs  , there golden sleep doth reign  .
they should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep  .
therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by some distemperature  .
therefore  , the fact that you 're awake this early tells me you 've been upset with some anxiety  .
or if not so  , then here i hit it right  : our romeo hath not been in bed tonight  .
if that 's not the case  , then this must be the answer  : you  , romeo  , have not been to bed tonight  .
that last is true  .
your last guess is right  .
the sweeter rest was mine  .
i enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep  .
god pardon sin  !
may god forgive you if you 've sinned  !
wast thou with rosaline  ?
were you with rosaline  ?

but where have you been  ?
be plain  , good son  , and homely in thy drift  .

riddling confession finds but riddling shrift  .
a jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution  .
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline  .
you scolded me often for loving rosaline  .
for doting  , not for loving  , pupil mine  .
i scolded you for obsessing about her  , not for loving her  , my student  .
and badest me bury love  .
and you told me to bury my love  .
not in a grave  , to lay one in  , another out to have  .
i did n't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another  .
i pray thee  , chide not  .
please  , i beg you  , do n't scold me  .
her i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow  .
the girl i love now returns my love  .
the other did not so  .
the other girl did not love me  .
oh  , let us hence  .
let 's get out of here  .
i stand on sudden haste  .
i 'm in a rush  .
wisely and slow  .
go wisely and slowly  .
they stumble that run fast  .
those who rush stumble and fall  .
where the devil should this romeo be  ?
where the devil can romeo be  ?

any man that can write may answer a letter  .
any man who knows how to write can answer a letter  .
nay  , he will answer the letter 's master  , how he dares  , being dared  .
no  , romeo will respond to the letter 's writer  , telling him whether he accepts the challenge  .
why  , what is tybalt  ?
why  , what 's tybalt 's story  ?

a very tall man  !
i hate it when they say  , by jesus  , this is a very good blade  , a very brave man  , a very good whore  .
a very good whore  !
is n't this a sad thing  , my good man  ?
why  , is not this a lamentable thing  , grandsire  , that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies  , these fashion - mongers  , these pardon me 's  , who stand so much on the new form  , that they can not sit at ease on the old bench  ?
why should we put up with these foreign buzzards  , these fashionmongers  , these guys who say pardon me  , these guys who care so much about manners that they ca n't kick back on a bench without whining  ?

here comes the lady  .
here comes the lady  .
oh  , so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint  .
oh  , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life  .
a lover may bestride the gossamers that idles in the wanton summer air  , and yet not fall  .
lovers are so light they can walk on a spiderweb floating on a summer breeze  , and yet not fall  .
so light is vanity  .
that 's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is  .
good even to my ghostly confessor  .
good evening  , my spiritual confessor  .
romeo shall thank thee  , daughter  , for us both  .
romeo will thank you  , my girl  , for both of us  .
as much to him  , else is his thanks too much  .
i 'll give him equal thanks  , so we 're even  .
ah  , juliet  , if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine  , and that thy skill be more to blazon it  , then sweeten with thy breath this neighbor air  , and let rich music 's tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter  .
ah  , juliet if you 're as happy as i am  , and you 're better with words  , tell me about the happiness you imagine we 'll have in our marriage  .
conceit  , more rich in matter than in words  , brags of his substance  , not of ornament  .
i can imagine more than i can say i have more on my mind than words  .
they are but beggars that can count their worth  .
anyone who can count how much he has is poor  .
but my true love is grown to such excess i can not sum up sum of half my wealth  .
my true love has made me so rich that i ca n't count even half of my wealth  .
come  , come with me  , and we will make short work  .
come  , come with me  , and we 'll do the job quickly  .
for  , by your leaves  , you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one  .
because if you do n't mind  , i 'm not leaving you two alone until you 're united in marriage  .
thou art like one of those fellows that  , when he enters the confines of a tavern  , claps me his sword upon the table and says god send me no need of thee  !
you 're like one of those guys who walks into a bar  , slams his sword on the table  , and then says  , i pray i never have to use you  .
and  , by the operation of the second cup  , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need  .
by the time he orders his second drink  , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all  .
am i like such a fellow  ?
am i really like one of those guys  ?
and what to  ?
and what about that  ?
nay  , an there were two such  , we should have none shortly  , for one would kill the other  .
if there were two men like you  , pretty soon there 'd be none because the two of you would kill each other  .
thou  , why  , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast  .
you would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard  .
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts  , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes  .
you 'll fight with a man who 's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut - colored eyes  .
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel  ?
only you would look for a fight like that  .
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat  , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling  .
your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk  , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting  .
thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun  .
you started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun  .
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter  ?
did n't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season  ?
with another  , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon  ?
and with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces  ?
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling  !
and yet you 're the one who wants to teach me about restraint  !
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art  , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter  .
if i were in the habit of fighting the way you are  , my life insurance rates would be sky high  .
the fee simple  ?
your life insurance  ?
o simple  !
that 's foolish  .

before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face  , she was the fairest creature in the world and even now she has no equal  .
will 't please your mightiness to wash your hands  ?
would your mightiness care to wash his hands  ?
o  , how we joy to see your wit restored  !
we 're overjoyed to see you sane again  .
o  , that once more you knew but what you are  !
if only you had a clearer memory of who you are  !
these fifteen years you have been in a dream or  , when you waked  , so waked as if you slept  .
these past fifteen years you have been living in a dream  , and even when you were awake  , it was as though you slept  .
these fifteen years  !
fifteen years  !
by my fay  , a goodly nap  .
that 's some nap  .
but did i never speak of all that time  ?
but i never spoke the whole time  ?
o  , yes  , my lord  , but very idle words  .
oh yes  , you spoke  , my lord  , but total nonsense  .
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber  , yet would you say ye were beaten out of door  ; and rail upon the hostess of the house  , and say you would present her at the leet  , because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts  .
for instance  , you 'd be lying here in this comfortable room  , but you 'd that you were being thrown out of some tavern and would shout at a landlady about how you were going to take her to court for cheating you  .
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket  .
sometimes you would call out for one cicely hacket  .
ay  , the woman 's maid of the house  .
yes  , the landlady 's maid  .
why  , sir  , you know no house nor no such maid  , nor no such men as you have reckoned up  , as stephen sly and old john naps of greece  , and peter turph and henry pimpernell  , and twenty more such names and men as these  , which never were  , nor no man ever saw  .
but sir  , there is no such house  , no such maid  , and no such men as you have dreamed up  , like a certain stephen sly and one old john naps of greece  , a peter turph  , one henry pimpernell  , and twenty more men of this sort who never actually existed  .
now lord be thanked for my good amends  !
well  , thank god i 'm cured  !
amen  .
amen  .
i thank thee  .
i thank you all  .
thou shalt not lose by it  .
you wo n't regret this  .
how fares my noble lord  ?
how is my noble lord  ?
here  , noble lord  .
here  , noble lord  .
what is thy will with her  ?
what is your wish with regard to her  ?
are you my wife and will not call me husband  ?
you call yourself my wife  , yet you do n't call me husband  ?
my men should call me lord  .
it 's my men who should call me lord  .
i am your goodman  .
i 'm your man  , your fellow  .
i know it well  .
yes  , i see  .
what must i call her  ?
lord what should i call her  ?
madam  .
madam  .
madam  , and nothing else  .

so lords call ladies  .
that 's how noblemen address their wives  .
madam wife  , they say that i have dreamed and slept above some fifteen year or more  .
madam wife  , they say i 've been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years  .
ay  , and the time seems thirty unto me  , being all this time abandoned from your bed  .
yes  , and it seemed twice as long to me  , having been kept from your bed that whole time  .
't is much  .
that 's too long  .
servants  , leave me and her alone  .
servants  , leave her and me alone  .
madam  , undress you and come now to bed  .
now  , madam  , undress and come to bed  .
thrice noble lord  , let me entreat of you to pardon me yet for a night or two  , or if not so  , until the sun be set  .
thrice noble lord  , i beg you to excuse me for another night or two or at least until nightfall  .
for your physicians have expressly charged  , in peril to incur your former malady  , that i should yet absent me from your bed  .
your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you  , as there 's a risk that you might have a relapse  .
i hope this reason stands for my excuse  .
i hope this explanation will stand as my excuse  .
marry  , i will  .
okay  , bring on the play  .
let them play it  .
but what 's a  ?
is not a comonty a christmas gambold or a tumbling - trick  ?
some sort of christmas skit or display of acrobatics  ?
no  , my good lord  , it is more pleasing stuff  .
no  , my good lord  , this is nicer stuff  .
what  , household stuff  ?
what  , like stuff from a house  ?
it is a kind of history  .
no  , it 's a story  .
master  , some show to welcome us to town  .
maybe it 's a parade to welcome us to town  , master  .
baptista i pray you  , sir  , is it your will to make a stale of me amongst these mates  ?
baptista may i ask  , sir  , if it 's your intention to publicly humiliate me  , showing me off like a whore in front of these suitors  ?
from all such devils  , good lord  , deliver us  !
may the good lord keep me safe from all women like her  !
and me too  , good lord  !
me too  , lord  !
tranio but in the other 's silence do i see maid 's mild behavior and sobriety  .
tranio but her sister seems quiet and well behaved  , as a young girl should be  .
peace  , tranio  .
shhh  , tranio  .
lucentio well said  , master  .
lucentio indeed  , master  .
mum  , and gaze your fill  .
let 's keep quiet and watch  .
a pretty peat  !
what a spoiled little brat  .
it is best put finger in the eye  , an she knew why  .
she 'd make herself cry now  , if she could think of a reason  .
sister  , content you in my discontent  .
sister  , be happy in my unhappiness  .
sir  , to your pleasure humbly i subscribe  .
sir  , i will humbly obey you  .
my books and instruments shall be my company  , on them to look and practice by myself  .
i 'll take comfort in my books and music  , reading and practicing my instruments  .
hark  , tranio  !

thou may'st hear minerva speak  .

signior baptista  , will you really be this cruel  ?
sorry am i that our goodwill effects bianca 's grief  .
i regret that our goodwill should cause bianca unhappiness  .
gentlemen  , content ye  .
gentlemen  , i 've made my decision  .
i am resolved  .
that 's all there is to it  .
go in  , bianca  .
go inside  , bianca  .
what 's that  , i pray  ?
and that would be  ?
marry  , sir  , to get a husband for her sister  .
to find a husband for her sister  .
a husband  ?
a husband  ?
a devil  !
you mean a devil  !
i say a husband  .

think'st thou  , hortensio  , though her father be very rich  , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell  ?
do you really think there 's a man fool enough to marry into hell however rich the father is  ?
i can not tell  .
i do n't know  .
but i had as lief take her dowry with this condition  : to be whipped at the high cross every morning  .
all i know is rather endure a public whipping every morning than put up with her even with a big dowry  .
faith  , as you say  , there 's small choice in rotten apples  .
the two choices are about equal  , it 's true  .
but come  , since this bar in law makes us friends  , it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping baptista 's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband  , and then have to 't afresh  .
but come  , since we must be friends in the face of this new obstacle  , let 's work together to find a husband for baptista 's elder daughter  , and thus free his younger daughter to have a husband  , too  .
sweet bianca  !
then we can go back to fighting with each other  .
happy man be his dole  !
happy the man that claims you  , sweet bianca  !
he that runs fastest gets the ring  .
and may the best man win  .

gramercies  , lad  , go forward  .
yes  , you 're right  .
this contents  .

the rest will comfort  , for thy counsel 's sound  .
i feel better already  , and i know there 's more good advice where that came from  .
master  , you looked so longly on the maid  , perhaps you marked not what 's the pith of all  .
master  , you were so focused on the girl herself  , i wonder if you missed the main point here  .
saw you no more  ?
that 's all you noticed  ?
marked you not how her sister began to scold and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure the din  ?
you missed the part where her sister began to scold her and made such a ruckus that human ears could hardly stand it  ?
tranio  , i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air  .
tranio  , i saw her coral - pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath  .
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her  .
i saw nothing in her except what is virtuous and lovely  .
ah  , tranio  , what a cruel father 's he  !
oh  , tranio  , what a cruel father he is  .
but art thou not advised  , he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her  ?
still  , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her  ?
ay  , marry  , am i  , sir  ; and now 't is plotted  !
i did and now i 've got it  !
i have it  , tranio  !
tranio  , i think i 've got it  !

do you think it would work  ?
aye  , sir  .
of course  , sir  .
ne'er a whit  .
not a word  .
and not a jot of tranio in your mouth  .
and you 're not to utter a syllable of tranio 's name  .
tranio is changed into lucentio  .
tranio is now lucentio  .
the better for him  .
lucky for him  .
would i were so too  .
wish i could say the same  .

we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art  .
you 're more scared of drowning than we are  .
i 'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench  .
yes  , i guarantee he wo n't drown even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman  .
what  , must our mouths be cold  ?
what  , we 're going to die  ?
the king and prince at prayers  .
the king and the prince are praying  .
let 's assist them  , for our case is as theirs  .

we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards  .
yes  , we 've been cheated out of our lives by a bunch of drunken  , incompetent sailors  .
this wide - chopped rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides  !
this bigmouth jerk here  ( boatswain i hope you drown ten times over  !
he 'll be hanged yet  , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him  .

right now i 'd give a thousand of sea for one little acre of dry ground  : barren weed patch  , anything at all  .
the wills above be done  , but i would fain die a dry death  .
what 's destined to happen will happen  , but i 'd give anything to be dry when i die  .
if by your art  , my dearest father  , you have put the wild waters in this roar  , allay them  .
dear father  , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers  , please put an end to it  .
the sky  , it seems  , would pour down stinking pitch  , but that the sea  , mounting to th ' welkin 's cheek  , dashes the fire out  .
the sky 's so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea were n't swelling up to the sky to put its fire out  .
oh  , i have suffered with those that i saw suffer  .
oh  , i suffered along with all the men i watched suffer  !
a brave vessel who had  , no doubt  , some noble creature in her dashed all to pieces  .
a fine ship  , with some good people in it  , i 'm sure  , smashed to pieces  .
oh  , the cry did knock against my very heart  !
their dying shouts broke my heart  !
poor souls  , they perished  .
the poor people died  .
had i been any god of power  , i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the fraughting souls within her  .
if i 'd been a god i would 've let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying  .
be collected  .
calm down  .
no more amazement  .
there 's nothing to get upset about  .

a house  , a person  ?
of anything the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance  .

't is far off  , and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants  .
my memory is hazy  , more like a dream than a recollection  .
had i not four or five women once that tended me  ?
did n't i use to have four or five women taking care of me  ?
but that i do not  .

twelve years ago  , miranda  , twelve years ago your father was the duke of milan  , a powerful prince  .
sir  , are not you my father  ?
are n't you my father  ?
thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter  .
your mother was extremely virtuous  , and she said you were my daughter  .
and thy father was duke of milan  , and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued  .
and your father was duke of milan  , and you were his heir  , a princess  .
oh  , the heavens  !
good lord  !
what foul play had we that we came from thence  ?
what evil things were done to us that we were driven here  ?
or bless was 't we did  ?
or was it a blessing that we came here  ?
oh  , my heart bleeds to think o ' th ' teen that i have turned you to  , which is from my remembrance  !
oh  , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this  , things that i ca n't remember  .
please you  , farther  .
but please tell me more  .
my brother and thy uncle  , called antonio i pray thee  , mark me  ( that a brother should be so perfidious  !  )
my brother  , your uncle antonio just listen to this  ( i still ca n't believe a brother could be so disloyal  !  )
he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state  , as at that time through all the signories it was the first  , and prospero the prime duke  , being so reputed in dignity  , and for the liberal arts without a parallel  .
my brother whom aside from you i loved more than anyone else in the world  , i trusted to run my state  , which at that time was the strongest in the land  , and prospero the number one duke  , famous for my dignity and my education  .
those being all my study  , the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger  , being transported and rapt in secret studies  .
since i was so drawn to studying things like logic  , grammar  , geometry  , and astronomy  , i let my control of the government slide a bit  , being too wrapped up in my occult books  .
thy false uncle dost thou attend me  ?
your disloyal uncle are you paying attention  ?
sir  , most heedfully  .
i 'm hanging on every word  .
o  , good sir  , i do  .
oh  , yes i am  , father  .
oh  , the heavens  !
good heavens  !
mark his condition and the event  .
think about that  , and about what followed afterward  .
then tell me if this might be a brother  .
then tell me if antonio can be called a brother  .
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother  .
it would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother  .
good wombs have borne bad sons  .
good women sometimes give birth to bad sons  .
alack  , for pity  !
how awful  !
i  , not remembering how i cried out then  , will cry it o'er again  .
i ca n't remember how i cried then  , but i 'll cry all over again  .
it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to 't  .
this story breaks my heart  .
hear a little further and then i 'll bring thee to the present business which now 's upon 's  , without the which this story were most impertinent  .
just listen a little more  , and i 'll bring you up to date about the present situation  , which is the whole reason i 'm telling you this story in the first place  .
wherefore did they not that hour destroy us  ?
why did n't they just kill us that night  ?
well demanded  , wench  .
good question  , my girl  .
my tale provokes that question  .
my story does raise that question  .
dear  , they durst not  , so dear the love my people bore me  , nor set a mark so bloody on the business  , but with colors fairer painted their foul ends  .
the answer  , my dear  , is that they did n't dare  , because the people of milan loved me too much  .
in few  , they hurried us aboard a bark  , bore us some leagues to sea  , where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt  , not rigged  , nor tackle  , sail  , nor mast  .
the had to disguise their bloody intentions  .
the very rats instinctively had quit it  .
so  , to make a long story short  , they hurried us onto a ship and carried us a number of miles out to sea  , where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat  , with no sails or masts or ropes  , which even the rats had abandoned  .
there they hoist us to cry to th ' sea that roared to us  , to sigh to th ' winds whose pity  , sighing back again  , did us but loving wrong  .
they tossed us in the water to cry to the sea that roared back at us  , to sigh into the winds that sighed right back at us in pity  .
alack  , what trouble was i then to you  !
god  , what a burden on you i must have been  !
how came we ashore  ?
how did we manage to get ashore  ?
would i might but ever see that man  !
i wish i could see that man someday  !
now i arise  .
now i 'll stand up  .
sit still  , and hear the last of our sea - sorrow  .
sit still and listen to the last of our sad sea adventures  .
here in this island we arrived  , and here have i  , thy schoolmaster  , made thee more profit than other princesses can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful  .
we arrived here on this island  , where i  , acting as your teacher  , have given you a better education than most princesses get  , princesses who have less careful tutors  , who spend their time instead on empty fun  .
heavens thank you for 't  !
may god thank you for it  .
and now  , i pray you  , sir for still 't is beating in my mind your reason for raising this sea storm  ?
but please  , father the question is still nagging at me why did you conjure up this storm  ?
know thus far forth  : by accident most strange  , bountiful fortune  ( now my dear lady  ) hath mine enemies brought to this shore  .
you should know this  : much luck is on my side  , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island  .
and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star  , whose influence if now i court not but omit  , my fortunes will ever after droop  .
as i see it  , my fate hangs on this lucky event  , and if i handle it wrong  , i 'll suffer for the rest of my life  .
here cease more questions  .
now  , no more questions  .
thou art inclined to sleep  .
you look sleepy  .
't is a good dullness  , and give it way  .
it 's a nice hazy feeling  , so give in to it  .
i know thou canst not choose  .
i know you have no choice  .
come away  , servant  , come  .
come on  , servant  , come  .
i am ready now  .
i 'm ready now  .
approach  , my ariel  , come  .
come here  , ariel  .
all hail  , great master  !
humble greetings  , great master  !
grave sir  , hail  !
worthy sir  , greetings  !
i come to answer thy best pleasure  , be 't to fly  , to swim  , to dive into the fire  , to ride on the curled clouds  .
your wish is my command  , whatever you want  .
to thy strong bidding  , task ariel and all his quality  .
if you want me to fly  , to swim  , to jump into fire  , to ride the clouds in the sky  , ariel will get right to the task  .
hast thou  , spirit  , performed to point the tempest that i bade thee  ?
spirit  , did you carry out the storm just as i ordered  ?
my brave spirit  !
good spirit  !
who was so firm  , so constant  , that this coil would not infect his reason  ?
who could ever be so steady and strong that a disturbance like that would n't make him crazy  ?
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation  .
everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts  .
all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel  , then all afire with me  .
everyone except the sailors dove into the sea  , leaving behind the ship that i had set on fire  .
the king 's son  , ferdinand  , with hair up - staring then  , like reeds  , not hair was the first man that leaped  , cried  , hell is empty and all the devils are here  .
the king 's son  , ferdinand  , with his hair standing straight up it looked like reeds  , not hair was the first person to jump  , shouting  , hell is empty  , and all the devils are here  !
why  , that 's my spirit  !
good job  !
but was not this nigh shore  ?
but was this near the shore  ?
close by  , my master  .
very near  , my master  .
but are they  , ariel  , safe  ?
but are they all safe  , ariel  ?
of the king 's ship  , the mariners  , say how thou hast disposed  , and all the rest o ' th ' fleet  .
tell me what you did with the king 's ship  , the sailors  , and the other ships  .
the mariners all under hatches stowed  , who  , with a charm joined to their suffered labor  , i have left asleep  .
the sailors are all below deck  , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell i cast over them  .
and for the rest o ' th ' fleet  , which i dispersed  , they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean float  , bound sadly home for naples  , supposing that they saw the king 's ship wracked and his great person perish  .
as for the rest of the ships  , i scattered them  , and they 've gathered again in the mediterranean  , sailing sadly home to naples  , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king  .
ariel  , thy charge exactly is performed  .
ariel  , you 've done your work exactly as i ordered  .
but there 's more work  .
but there 's more work to be done  .
what is the time o ' th ' day  ?
what time is it  ?
past the mid season  .
past noon  .
at least two glasses  .
at least two hours past  .
the time 'twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously  .
we ca n't waste time between now and six o'clock  .
is there more toil  ?
is there more work to do  ?
since thou dost give me pains  , let me remember thee what thou hast promised  , which is not yet performed me  .
since you 're giving me new assignments  , let me remind you what you promised me but have n't come through with yet  .
how now  ?
what  ?
moody  ?
you 're in a bad mood  ?
what is 't thou canst demand  ?
what could you possibly ask for  ?
my liberty  .
my freedom  .
before the time be out  ?
before your sentence has been completed  ?
no more  !
do n't say anything else  .
i prithee  , remember i have done thee worthy service  , told thee no lies  , made thee no mistakings  , served without or grudge or grumblings  .
i beg you  , remember the good work i 've done for you  , and how i 've never lied to you  , never made mistakes  , and never grumbled in my work  .
thou didst promise to bate me a full year  .
you promised to take a full year off my sentence  .
dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee  ?
have you forgotten the torture i freed you from  ?
no  .
no  .
thou dost  , and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep  , to run upon the sharp wind of the north  , to do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth when it is baked with frost  .
you have forgotten  , and you think it 's a burden when i ask you to walk through the ocean  , or run on the north wind  , or do business for me underground when the earth 's frozen solid  .
i do not  , sir  .
no  , i do n't  , sir  .
thou liest  , malignant thing  !
you lie  , you nasty  , ungrateful thing  !
hast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax  , who with age and envy was grown into a hoop  ?
have you forgotten the horrid witch sycorax  , stooped over with old age and ill will  ?
hast thou forgot her  ?
have you forgotten her  ?
no  , sir  .
no  , sir  .
thou hast  .
you have  .
where was she born  ?
where was she born  ?
speak  .
speak  .
tell me  .
tell me  .
sir  , in argier  .
in algiers  , sir  .
oh  , was she so  ?
oh  , was she now  ?
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been  , which thou forget'st  .
i 'll have to tell the story again every month  , since you seem to forget it  .
this damned witch sycorax  , for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing  , from argier  , thou know'st  , was banished  .
this damned witch sycorax was kicked out of algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about  .
for one thing she did they would not take her life  .
but for one reason they refused to execute her  .
is not this true  ?
is n't that true  ?
ay  , sir  .
yes  , sir  .
yes  , caliban  , her son  .
yes  , caliban  , her son  .
dull thing  , i say so  .
that 's right  , you stupid thing  .
he  , that caliban whom now i keep in service  .
caliban  , who now serves me  .
thou best know'st what torment i did find thee in  .
you know better than anyone how tortured you were when i found you  .
thy groans of ever angry bears  .
your groans made wolves howl  , and even made bears feel sorry for you  .
it was a torment did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts to lay upon the damned  , which sycorax could not again undo  .
nobody but the damned souls of hell deserves the spell that sycorax put on you and could n't undo  .
it was mine art  , when i arrived and heard thee  , that made gape the pine and let thee out  .
it was my magic that saved you when i arrived on the island and heard you  , making the pine tree open and let you out  .
i thank thee  , master  .
thank you  , master  .
if thou more murmur'st  , i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howled away twelve winters  .
if you complain any more  , i 'll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you 've howled for twelve years  .
pardon  , master  .
please forgive me  , master  .
i will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently  .
i 'll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining  .
do so  , and after two days i will discharge thee  .
do that  , and i 'll set you free in two days  .
that 's my noble master  !
that 's noble of you  , master  .
what shall i do  ?
what shall i do for you  ?
say  , what  ?
just tell me  .
what shall i do  ?
what shall i do  ?
go make thyself like a nymph o ' th ' sea  .
go disguise yourself as a sea nymph  .
be subject to no sight but thine and mine  , invisible to every eyeball else  .
be invisible to everyone except yourself and me  .
go take this shape and hither come in 't  .
take this garment  , put it on  , and then come back here  .
go hence with diligence  .
hurry  , go  !
the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me  .
your strange story made me groggy  .
shake it off  .
shake off your sleepiness  .
come on  .
come on  .
we 'll visit caliban  , my slave who never yields us kind answer  .
we 'll go visit caliban  , my slave who always talks to us so nastily  .
there 's wood enough within  .

my lord it shall be done  .
my lord  , i 'll do it right away  .
caliban thou poisonous slave  , got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam  , come forth  !
caliban you horrible slave  , with a wicked hag for a mother and the devil himself for a father  , come out  !
as wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven 's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both  !
i hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow 's feather from the poison swamps  .
a southwest blow on ye and blister you all o'er  !
may a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over  .
for this  , be sure  , tonight thou shalt have cramps  , side - stitches that shall pen thy breath up  .
i 'll give you cramps for saying that horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing  .
urchins shall  , forth at vast of night that they may work  , all exercise on thee  .
i 'll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you  .
thou shalt be pinched as thick as honeycomb  , each pinch more stinging than bees that made 'em  .
you 'll be pricked all over  , and it 'll sting like bees  .
thou most lying slave  , whom stripes may move  , not kindness  !
you liar  , you respond better to the whip than to kindness  !
i have used thee  , filth as thou art  , with human care  , and lodged thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honor of my child  .
i took good care of you piece of filth that you are and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter  .
oh ho  , oh ho  !
oh ho  , oh ho  !
would 't had been done  !
i wish i had  !
thou didst prevent me  .
you stopped me  .
i had peopled else this isle with calibans  .
if you had n't  , i would have filled this island with a race of calibans  .
abhorrd slave  , which any print of goodness wilt not take  , being capable of all ill  !
you horrid slave  , you ca n't be trained to be good  , and you 're capable of anything evil  !
i pitied thee  , took pains to make thee speak  , taught thee each hour one thing or other  .
i pitied you  , worked hard to teach you to speak  , and taught you some new thing practically every hour  .
when thou didst not  , savage  , know thine own meaning  , but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish  , i endowed thy purposes with words that made them known  .
when you did n't know what you were saying  , and were babbling like an animal  , i helped you find words to make your point understandable  .
but thy vile race  , though thou didst learn  , had that in 't which good natures could not abide to be with  .
but you had bad blood in you  , no matter how much you learned  , and good people could n't stand to be near you  .
therefore wast thou deservedly confined into this rock  , who hadst deserved more than a prison  .
so you got what you deserved  , and were locked up in this cave  , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be  .
you taught me language  , and my profit on 't is i know how to curse  .
you taught me language  , and all i can do with it is curse  .
the red plague rid you for learning me your language  !
damn you for teaching me your language  !
no  , pray thee  .
no  , please  .
i must obey  .
i have to obey  .
his art is of such power  , it would control my dam 's god  , setebos  , and make a vassal of him  .

so  , slave  , hence  !
go then  , slave  .

i hear the tune of the strutting rooster who cries cock - a - doodle - doo  .
where should this music be  ?
where 's that music coming from  ?
i ' th ' air or th ' earth  ?
from the earth  , or the air  ?
it sounds no more  , and sure  , it waits upon some god o ' th ' island  .
it 's stopped now it must be played for some local god of the island  .
sitting on a bank  , weeping again the king my father 's wrack  , this music crept by me upon the waters  , allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air  .
as i sat on the shore crying over my father 's shipwreck  , i heard the music creep over the wild waves  , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies  .
thence i have followed it  , or it hath drawn me rather  .
i followed it here  , or i should say it dragged me here  .
but 't is gone  .
but now it 's stopped  .
no  , it begins again  .
no  , there it is again  .

the ditty does remember my drowned father  .
this song 's about my dead father  .
this is no mortal business  , nor no sound that the earth owes  .
it could n't be sung by mere mortals  .
i hear it now above me  .
i hear it now overhead  .
miranda the fringd curtains of thine eye advance and say what thou seest yond  .
miranda raise the curtains of your eyelids and go take a peek at what you can see out there  .
what is 't  ?
what is it  ?
a spirit  ?
a spirit  ?
lord  , how it looks about  !
lord  , it 's glancing every which way  !
believe me  , sir  , it carries a brave form  .
how handsome it is  .
but 't is a spirit  .
it must be a spirit  .
i might call him a thing divine  , for nothing natural i ever saw so noble  .
i could imagine he 's divine  , since i never saw anything so noble - looking on earth before  .
miranda most sure  , the goddess on whom these airs attend  !
miranda this must surely be the goddess that the music is being played for  !
vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island  , and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here  .
please  , i beg you to answer me  , tell me if you live on this island  , and tell me how i should behave here  .
my prime request  , which i do last pronounce  , is o you wonder  !
my main question  , which i save for the last  , is oh  , you marvelous creature  !
if you be maid or no  .
are you a maiden or a goddess  ?
no wonder  , sir  , but certainly a maid  .
i 'm not marvelous  , sir  , but i 'm certainly a maiden  .
my language  !
she speaks my language  !
heavens  , i am the best of them that speak this speech  , were i but where 't is spoken  .
my god  , i 'm the highest - ranking person who speaks this language if only we were back where it 's spoken  .
how  ?
what 's that  ?
the best  ?
the highest - ranking  ?
what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee  ?
what would the king of naples do if he heard you say that  ?
a single thing  , as i am now  , that wonders to hear thee speak of naples  .
he would just see me for what i am  , a person amazed to hear you talking about naples  .
he does hear me  , and that he does i weep  .
he does hear me  , and that makes me cry  .
myself am naples  , who with mine eyes  , never since at ebb  , beheld the king my father wracked  .
i myself am the king of naples  , since i saw with my own eyes these eyes that have n't been dry since my father killed in a shipwreck  .
alack  , for mercy  !
ah  , how pitiful  !
yes  , faith  , and all his lords  , the duke of milan and his brave son being twain  .
yes  , indeed  , and all the king 's men  , the duke of milan and his fine son too  .
the duke of milan and his more braver daughter could control thee if now 'twere fit to do 't  !
the real duke of milan and his far finer daughter could beat you in a heartbeat  , if it were the right time  .
at the first sight they have changed eyes  .
they 've fallen in love at first sight  !
delicate ariel  , i 'll set thee free for this  .
wonderful ariel  , i 'll set you free for doing such good work here  .
ferdinand a word  , good sir  .
ferdinand could i have a word with you  , sir  ?
i fear you have done yourself some wrong  .
i 'm afraid you 've made a mistake  .
a word  .
just a word  .
why speaks my father so ungently  ?
why is my father speaking to him so rudely  ?
this is the third man that e'er i saw  , the first that e'er i sighed for  .
this is the third man i 've ever seen in my life  , and the first one i 've felt romantic feelings for  .
pity move my father to be inclined my way  !
i hope my father takes pity on me and treats him well for my sake  !
miranda oh  , if a virgin  , and your affection not gone forth  , i 'll make you the queen of naples  .
oh  , if you 're a virgin  , and you have n't given your heart to another man  , then i 'll make you the queen of naples  .
no  , as i am a man  !
no  , i swear  , that 's not true  !
there 's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple  .
a man as handsome as that ca n't have anything evil in him  .
if the ill spirit have so fair a house  , good things will strive to dwell with 't  .
if the devil had such a beautiful house as his body  , then good things would fight to live in it  .
beseech you  , father  .
please  , father  , i beg you  .
hence  !
let go of me  !
hang not on my garments  .
do n't tug on my clothes  .
my affections are then most humble  .
then my love is humble  .
i have no ambition to see a goodlier man  .
i do n't feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one  .
ferdinand come on  .
ferdinand come on  .
obey  .
obey my orders  .
thy nerves are in their infancy again and have no vigor in them  .
your muscles are all limp and lifeless  .
so they are  .
that 's true  , they are  .
my spirits  , as in a dream  , are all bound up  .
my strength is all gone  , as if in a dream  .
my father 's loss  , the weakness which i feel  , the wrack of all my friends  , nor this man 's threats  , to whom i am subdued  , are but light to me  , might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid  .
the death of my father  , my physical weakness  , the loss of all my friends  , the threats of this man who 's taken me prisoner all that would be easy for me to take  , if only i could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl  .
all corners else o ' th ' earth let liberty make use of  .
i do n't need any more freedom than that  .
space enough have i in such a prison  .
a prison like that would give me enough liberty  .
it works  !
it 's working  !
ferdinand come on  .
ferdinand come on  .
thou hast done well  , fine ariel  !
you 've done well  , ariel  .
ferdinand follow me  .
ferdinand follow me  .
ariel hark what thou else shalt do me  .
ariel listen to what you 'll do for me next  .
ariel thou shalt be free as mountain winds  .
ariel you 'll be free as a bird  .
but then exactly do all points of my command  .
but you have to do exactly what i order  .
to th ' syllable  .
down to the last detail  .
ferdinand come  , follow  .
ferdinand come  , follow me  .
miranda speak not for him  .
miranda do n't defend him  .
prithee  , peace  .

antonio he receives comfort like cold porridge  .
antonio alonso enjoys these comforting words about as much as cold oatmeal  .
sebastian the visitor will not give him o'er so  .
sebastian but the goodwill ambassador wo n't give up that easily  .
look he 's winding up the watch of his wit  .
antonio look  .
by and by it will strike  .
he 's like a clock winding up to strike the hour  .
alonso sir
alonso sir
antonio one  .
antonio there he goes  !
tell  .
now we can tell what time it is  .
when every grief is entertained that 's offered  , comes to th ' entertainer
if we let every sad thing that happens to us get us down  , then we would find ourselves
a dollar  .
what a pain  .
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should  .
you 're taking it more seriously than i meant it  .
alonso therefore  , my lord
alonso therefore  , sir
sebastian fie  , what a spendthrift is he of his tongue  !
sebastian god  , does n't he ever shut up  ?
gonzalo i prithee  , spare  .
gonzalo please  , no more  .
well  , i have done  .
well  , i 'm nearly finished  .
but yet
but just one last thing
antonio he will be talking  .
antonio he insists on talking  .
the old cock  .
the old guy  .
the cockerel  .
i pick the younger one  .
done  .
you 're on  .
the wager  ?
what 's the prize  ?
a laughter  .
a good laugh  .
a match  !
it 's a deal  !
though this island seem to be desert
though this island may appear desolate
sebastian ha  , ha  , ha  !
sebastian ha  , ha  , ha  !
so you 're paid  .
fine  , you win  .
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible  , as it were
yet
now he 's going to say but
yet
but
he could not miss 't  .
he had to say it  , it was unavoidable  .
it must needs be of subtle  , tender  , and delicate temperance  .
the island must be mild  , and have a temperate climate  .
temperance was a delicate wench  .
i knew temperance she was a fine girl  .
ay  , and a subtle  , as he most learnedly delivered  .
yes  , and she was mild too  .
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly  .
there 's always a breath of fresh air here  .
as if it had lungs  , and rotten ones  .
a breath from rotten lungs  , maybe  .
or as 'twere perfumed by a fen  .
stinking like a swamp  .
here is everything advantageous to life  .
this island contains everything beneficial to life  .
true  .
true  .
save means to live  .
everything except something to live on  .
of that there 's none  , or little  .
there 's little or nothing of that  .
how lush and lusty the grass looks  !
look how lush and healthy the grass is  !
how green  !
how green  !
the ground indeed is tawny  .
the ground is brown  .
with an eye of green in 't  .
with a touch of green in it  .
he misses not much  .
he does n't miss a thing  .
no  , he doth but mistake the truth totally  .
no  , he just gets reality completely wrong  .
but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit
but the really unbelievable thing is and this is incredible
as many vouched rarities are  .
as most unbelievable things are  .
that our garments  , being  , as they were  , drenched in the sea  , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses  , being rather new - dyed than stained with salt water  .
that our clothes were drenched with sea water  , but they came out looking brand - new  .
ay  , or very falsely pocket up his report  .
or stuff what he says into their pockets  .
methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric  , at the marriage of the king 's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis  .
seriously  , i think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in africa  , when we attended the marriage of the king 's daughter claribel to the king of tunis  .
't was a sweet marriage  , and we prosper well in our return  .
it was a lovely wedding  , and we 're doing really well on our trip home  .
tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen  .
tunis has never had such a beautiful queen  .
not since widow dido 's time  .
not since the days of widow  .
widow dido said you  ?
widow dido  , did you say  ?
you make me study of that  .
i 'm not sure about that  .
she was of carthage  , not of tunis  .
dido was from carthage  , not tunis  .
this tunis  , sir  , was carthage  .
carthage  , sir  .
carthage  ?
carthage  ?
i assure you  , carthage  .
i 'm telling you  , it was carthage  .
his word is more than the miraculous harp  .
gonzalo is a miracle - worker  .
he hath raised the wall and houses too  .
if he says carthage was here  , then carthage must be here  .
what impossible matter will he make easy next  ?
what miracle will he work next  ?
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple  .
i think he 'll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple  .
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea  , bring forth more islands  .
and then throw the seeds in the sea  , to make more islands grow  .
ay  .
yes indeed  .
why  , in good time  .
absolutely  , yes indeed  .
alonso sir  , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter  , who is now queen  .
alonso sir  , we were saying that our clothes seem just as fresh as they did when we attended the wedding of your daughter  , who 's now queen of tunis  .
and the rarest that e'er came there  .
the most beautiful queen they ever had  .
bate  , i beseech you  , widow dido  .
i beg your pardon  , except for the widow dido  .
oh  , widow dido  ?
oh  , except for the widow dido  ?
ay  , widow dido  .
that 's right  , except for the widow dido  .
is not  , sir  , my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it  ?
is n't my vest just as clean and fresh as the day i put it on  ?
i mean  , in a sort  .
in a way  , i mean  .
that sort was well fished for  .
in a way is the right way to go  .
when i wore it at your daughter 's marriage  ?
i mean when i wore it at your daughter 's wedding  .
no  , no  , he 's gone  .
no  , no  , he 's dead  .
prithee  , peace  .
please be quiet  .
you were kneeled to and importuned otherwise by all of us  , and the fair soul herself weighed between loathness and obedience  , at which end o ' th ' beam should bow  .
we all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans  , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an african and the desire to obey you  .
we have lost your son  , i fear  , forever  .
now i 'm afraid we 've lost your son forever  .
milan and naples have more widows in them of this business ' making than we bring men to comfort them  .
our shipwreck has made more women widows in milan and naples than there are survivors to comfort them  .
the fault 's your own  .
and it 's all your fault  .
so is the dearest o ' th ' loss  .
and the greatest sorrow is mine too  .
my lord sebastian  , the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in  .
my lord sebastian  , even though what you say is true  , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time  .
you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster  .
you 're rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages  .
very well  .
all right  , i 'll stop  .
and most chirurgeonly  .
like a good doctor  .
alonso it is foul weather in us all  , good sir  , when you are cloudy  .
alonso it 's bad times for all of us  , sir  , when you 're feeling gloomy  .
foul weather  ?
bad times  ?
very foul  .
yes  , very bad  .
had i plantation of this isle  , my lord
if i could colonize this island  , my lord
he 'd sow 't with nettle seed  .
he 'd cultivate weeds on it  .
or docks  , or mallows  .
or thorn - bushes  .
and were the king on 't  , what would i do  ?
and if i were king of it  , you know what i 'd do  ?
'scape being drunk for want of wine  .
he would n't get drunk much  , since there 's no wine here  .
yet he would be king on 't  .
he wants to be king in a place with no kingship  .
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning  .
yes  , he 's getting a bit confused  .
all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavor  .
everything would be produced without labor  , and would be shared by all  .
treason  , felony  , sword  , pike  , knife  , gun  , or need of any engine  , would i not have  .
there 'd be no treason  , crimes  , or weapons  .
but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison  , all abundance  , to feed my innocent people  .
nature would produce its harvests in abundance  , to feed my innocent people  .
no marrying 'mong his subjects  ?
there 'd be no marriage  ?
none  , man  .
no  .
all idle  .
everyone would have nothing to do  .
whores and knaves  .
they 'd all be whores and slackers  .
i would with such perfection govern  , sir  , t ' excel the golden age  .
i would rule so perfectly that my country would outshine the golden age they had in ancient times  .
'save his majesty  !
long live his majesty  !
long live gonzalo  !
all hail gonzalo  !
alonso and do you mark me  , sir  ?
alonso are you listening to me  , sir  ?
prithee  , no more  .
oh  , please be quiet  .
thou dost talk nothing to me  .
you 're spouting empty words  .
't was you we laughed at  .
it 's you we were laughing at  .
who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you  .
but from your perspective i do n't matter  , so i 'm just an empty nobody for you  .
so you may continue and laugh at nothing still  .
go ahead and laugh at my empty words some more  .
what a blow was there given  !
ouch  , what a comeback  !
you are gentlemen of brave mettle  .
you 're brave gentlemen  .
you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing  .
you 'd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit  .
we would so  , and then go a - batfowling  .
that 's right  , and then after we fixed the moon  , we 'd go bird - hunting  .
gonzalo nay  , good my lord  , be not angry  .
gonzalo do n't be angry with us  , my lord  .
go sleep  , and hear us  .
go to sleep  , and listen to us laughing  .
what  , all so soon asleep  ?
what  , everybody falls asleep so fast  ?
i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts  .
i wish i could sleep too it would stop me from thinking  .
i find they are inclined to do so  .
come to think of it  , i am feeling sleepy  .
please you  , sir  , do not omit the heavy offer of it  .
in that case you should sleep  .
it seldom visits sorrow  .
people in grief need a good sleep  .
when it doth  , it is a comforter  .
it does n't come to them often  , but when it does come they should enjoy it  .
we two  , my lord  , will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety  .
the two of us will guard you while you sleep  , my lord  , and keep you safe  .
thank you  .
thank you  .
wondrous heavy  .
i 'm terribly sleepy  .
what a strange drowsiness possesses them  !
how strange that they all got so sleepy  !
it is the quality o ' th ' climate  .
there must be something in the air here  .
why doth it not then our eyelids sink  ?
so why are n't our eyelids heavy  ?
i find not myself disposed to sleep  .
i 'm not sleepy at all  .
what  , art thou waking  ?
are you dreaming or awake  ?
do you not hear me speak  ?
do n't you hear me speaking  ?
i do  , and surely it is a sleepy language  , and thou speak'st out of thy sleep  .
i do  , and it sounds like you 're talking in your sleep  .
what is it thou didst say  ?
what did you say  ?
this is a strange repose  , to be asleep with eyes wide open  , standing  , speaking  , moving  , and yet so fast asleep  .
it 's weird for you to be dreaming with your eyes wide open standing  , talking  , moving  , but sound asleep  .
noble sebastian  , thou let'st thy fortune sleep die  , rather wink'st whiles thou art waking  .
good sebastian  , you 're the one who 's sleeping if you let this opportunity pass you by without acting on it  .
thou dost snore distinctly  .
you 're snoring  , but it sounds like you 're talking  .
there 's meaning in thy snores  .
there 's meaning in your snoring  .
well  , i am standing water  .
i 'm hanging on every word you say  .
do so  .
you need to  .
to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me  .
i 'm lazy by nature  .
oh  , if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it  !
oh  , if you only knew how close to success you are  , even while you make fun of what i 'm telling you  !
how  , in stripping it  , you more invest it  !
the more you joke about it  , the more clearly i feel how serious it is  !
ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth  .
lazy people end up at the bottom  , and you deserve to be at the top  .
prithee  , say on  .
please  , tell me more  .
the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee  , and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield  .
there 's something in your expression that tells me you have something serious to say  , and you 're having a lot of difficulty saying it  .
oh  , out of that no hope what great hope have you  !
but in that no hope there are great hopes for you  !
no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition can not pierce a wink beyond  , but doubt discovery there  .
that no hope means you 're on the way to glory so brilliant you could n't even imagine it  , no matter how ambitious you were  .
will you grant with me that ferdinand is drowned  ?
do you agree that ferdinand must have drowned  ?
he 's gone  .
he 's dead  .
then  , tell me  , who 's the next heir of naples  ?
so  , in that case  , tell me who 's next in line to inherit the kingdom of naples  ?
claribel  .
claribel  , his daughter  .
what stuff is this  ?
what in the world are you talking about  ?
how say you  ?
it 's true that my brother 's daughter is queen of tunis  , and heir of naples  .
't is true  , my brother 's daughter 's queen of tunis  , so is she heir of naples  , 'twixt which regions there is some space  .
and it 's true those two places are far apart  .
a space whose every cubit seems to cry out  , how shall that claribel measure us back to naples  ?
so far that every foot of distance between them seems to shout  , it 's too far for claribel to come back to naples  .
keep in tunis  ,
let her stay in tunis and give sebastian a
and let sebastian wake  .
chance to start living  .
say this were death that now hath seized them  .
if these sleeping men were dead instead of sleeping  , they 'd be no worse off than they are now  .
why  , they were no worse than now they are  .
there are a lot of men who can rule naples just as well as this sleeping guy here can  .
there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps  , lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo  .
there are a lot of men who babble nonsense as well as gonzalo  .
i myself could make a chough of as deep chat  .
i could do it myself  .
oh  , that you bore the mind that i do  , what a sleep were this for your advancement  !
oh  , i wish you understood what i 'm saying you 'd see how you 're missing out on a great opportunity for yourself  !
do you understand me  ?
do you even get what i 'm saying  ?
methinks i do  .
i think i do  .
and how does your content tender your own good fortune  ?
and does this prospect of good fortune make you happy  ?
i remember you did supplant your brother prospero  .
i remember you took the throne from your brother prospero  .
but  , for your conscience  ?
but what about your guilty conscience  ?
thy case  , dear friend  , shall be my precedent  .
you 'll be my role model  .
as thou got'st milan  , i 'll come by naples  .
just as you got milan  , i 'll get naples  .
draw thy sword  .
take out your sword  .
one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest  .
with one cut you can be through paying money to naples  .
and i the king shall love thee  .
and as king i 'll love you forever  .
draw together  .
you take out your sword too  .
and when i rear my hand  , do you the like  , to fall it on gonzalo  .
when i raise my hand  , you do the same  , and bring it down on gonzalo 's head  .
o  , but one word  .
oh  , but there 's one more thing to tell you  .
antonio
antonio

whiles we stood here securing your repose  , even now  , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls  , or rather lions  .
while we were here guarding you as you slept  , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls  , or lions  .

did n't you hear it  ?
it struck mine ear most terribly  .
we heard it very clearly  .
i heard nothing  .
i did n't hear anything  .
oh  , 't was a din to fright a monster 's ear  , to make an earthquake  !
oh  , it was a monstrous roar  , to make the earth tremble  !

i 'm sure there was a herd of lions nearby  .

did you hear this  , gonzalo  ?
upon mine honor  , sir  , i heard a humming  , and that a strange one too  , which did awake me  .

i shaked you  , sir  , and cried  .
i shook you and shouted at you  , sir  .
as mine eyes opened  , i saw their weapons drawn  .
when i opened my eyes  , i saw their swords out  .
there was a noise  , that 's verily  .
there was a noise  , that 's certainly true  .
't is best we stand upon our guard  , or that we quit this place  .
we should either be on guard here constantly or move to a different camp  .

here comes a spirit of his  , and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly  .
here comes one of his spirits to torture me for taking so long to bring the wood back  .
i 'll fall flat  .
i 'll lie down and hide  .
perchance he will not mind me  .
maybe he wo n't see me  .
do not torment me  .
do n't hurt me  .

or it hath been said  , as proper a man as ever went on four legs can not make him give ground  , and it shall be said so again while stephano breathes at ' nostrils  .
i 'll never run away from any ordinary man who walks on four legs like the rest of us  .
the spirit torments me  .
the spirit is torturing me  .
oh  !
oh  !
this is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got  , as i take it  , an ague  .
this is some monster of the island  , with four legs  , who seems to me to have some kind of ache  .
where the devil should he learn our language  ?
how the hell does he know our language  ?
i will give him some relief if it be but for that  .
i 'll help out  , if only because he speaks the same language as me  .
if i can recover him and keep him tame and get to naples with him  , he 's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat 's leather  .
if i can cure him from his fever and tame him  , and get him back to naples  , he 'd make a great present for any emperor  .

i promise i 'll carry the wood faster  .
he 's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest  .
he 's having a fit and talking nonsense  .
he shall taste of my bottle  .
i 'll give him some liquor  .
if he have never drunk wine afore  , it will go near to remove his fit  .
if he 's never drunk it before  , it 'll help soothe his fever  .
if i can recover him and keep him tame  , i will not take too much for him  .
if i can tame him  , i 'll charge as much as i can get for him  .
he shall pay for him that hath him  , and that soundly  .
he 'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him  , that 's for sure  .
i should know that voice  .
i almost recognize that voice  .
it should be but he is drowned  , and these are devils  .
it 's but he 's drowned  , and these guys are devils  .

there be some sports are painful  , and their labor delight in them sets off  .
some games are painful  , but their discomfort makes them more fun  .
some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone  .
some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons  .
and most poor matters point to rich ends  .
and you can do poor things that lead to rich results  .
this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious  , but the mistress which i serve quickens what 's dead and makes my labors pleasures  .
this hard work would be boring and nasty to me  , but i 'm working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor  .
oh  , she is ten times more gentle than her father 's crabbed  , and he 's composed of harshness  .
oh  , she 's ten times nicer than her father is mean  , and he 's the height of crabbiness  .
i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up  , upon a sore injunction  .
i have thousands of logs to take away and pile up  , on strict orders from him  .
my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work  , and says such baseness had never like executor  .
my sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before  .
i forget  , but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors  , most busiest when i do it  .
these sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me  , especially when i 'm slaving away busily  .

if you sit down  , i 'll carry your logs a while  .
pray  , give me that  .
please give me that  .
i 'll carry it to the pile  .
i 'll take it over to the pile  .
it would become me as well as it does you  , and i should do it with much more ease  , for my good will is to it and yours it is against  .
i 'd be as right for the job as you are  , and i 'd do it more easily  , since i 'd have good will on my side  .

full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time
i 've looked at many ladies with pleasure  , and been
th ' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear  .
seduced by the sweet nothings they said to me  .
for several virtues have i liked several women  .
i 've liked several women for their good qualities  , but there was something wrong with each one that blotted her excellent qualities and cancelled them out  .
never any with so full soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil  .
but with you it 's different  .
but you  , o you  , so perfect and so peerless  , are created of every creature 's best  .

he 'd be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail  .
my man - monster hath drowned his tongue in sack  .
my man monster is so drunk he ca n't talk  .

i swam  , ere i could recover the shore  , five and thirty leagues off and on  .
before i could get to shore  , i swam thirty - five in it and still survived  .

we 're not going to run in our army  , monsieur monster  .

if your highness is willing  , take revenge on him for that because i know you 're brave enough  , i do n't dare to
that 's most certain  .
that 's for sure  .
thou shalt be lord of it and i 'll serve thee  .
you 'll be lord of the island then  , and i 'll be your servant  .
how now shall this be compassed  ?
and how would we go about doing that  ?
canst thou bring me to th ' party  ?
can you bring me to him  ?
yea  , yea  , my lord  .
yes  , yes  , my lord  .
i 'll yield him thee asleep  , where thou mayst knock a nail into his head  .
i 'll take you to where he sleeps  , and you can pound a nail into his head  .
thou liest  .
you lie  .
thou canst not  .
you ca n't do that  .
what a pied ninny 's this  !
what an idiot this guy is  !
thou scurvy patch  !
you 're a rotten piece of work  !
i do beseech thy greatness  , give him blows and take his bottle from him  .
i beg your highness  , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him  .
when that 's gone  , he shall drink naught but brine  , for i 'll not show him where the quick freshes are  .
when he loses that  , he 'll be drinking salt water  , since i 'll never tell him where the freshwater springs are  .
trinculo  , run into no further danger  .
trinculo  , watch out  .
interrupt the monster one word further  , and  , by this hand  , i 'll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stockfish of thee  .
if you interrupt this monster with one more word  , i 'll beat you like a piece of salted fish  .
why  , what did i  ?
what did i do  ?
i did nothing  .
i did n't do anything  .
i 'll go farther off  .
i need to get away from you  .
didst thou not say he lied  ?
did n't you call him a liar  ?
thou liest  .
you lie  .
trinculo do i so  ?
trinculo oh  , i did  ?
take thou that  .
take that  , then  .
trinculo as you like this  , give me the lie another time  .
trinculo if you want more beatings like that  , just accuse me of lying again  .
i did not give the lie  .
i did n't accuse you of lying  .
out o ' your wits and hearing too  ?
are you out of your mind and deaf too  ?
a pox o ' your bottle  !
damn your wine  !
this can sack and drinking do  .
this is what happens when you drink too much  .
a murrain on your monster  , and the devil take your fingers  !
your monster can go to hell  , and you can too  !
ha  , ha  , ha  !
ha  , ha  , ha  !

stand farther  .
stand farther away  .
come  , proceed  .
come on  , continue your story  .
why  , as i told thee  , 't is a custom with him  , i ' th ' afternoon to sleep  .
just as i told you  , he usually sleeps in the afternoon  .
there thou mayst brain him  , having first seized his books  ; or with a log batter his skull  ; or paunch him with a stake  ; or cut his weasand with thy knife  .
at that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books  ; or you can bash his skull with a log  ; or you can stab him in the belly  ; or cut his windpipe  .
remember first to possess his books  , for without them he 's but a sot  , as i am  , nor hath not one spirit to command  .
just remember to grab his books first  , since without them he 's just a poor fool like me  , and ca n't command a single spirit  .
they all do hate him as rootedly as i .
all the spirits hate him as much as i do  .
burn but his books  .
be sure to burn his magic books  .
he has brave utensils for so he calls them which when he has a house  , he 'll deck withal  .
he has some wonderful home furnishings that 's what he calls them that he 'll use to decorate his house when he gets one  .
and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter  .
the most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is  .
he himself calls her a nonpareil  .
he says she has no equal  .
i never saw a woman  , but only sycorax my dam and she  .
i never saw a woman except her and sycorax  , my mother  .
but she as far surpasseth sycorax as great'st does least  .
but miranda is so much more beautiful  , you ca n't even compare the two  .
is it so brave a lass  ?
is she really that wonderful  ?
monster  , i will kill this man  .
monster  , i 'll kill this man  .
his daughter and i will be king and queen save our graces  !
his daughter and i will be king and queen god protect us  !
and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys  .

give me thy hand  .

i am sorry i beat thee  .
i 'm sorry i hit you  .
but while thou livest  , keep a good tongue in thy head  .
but try to control your speech  .
within this half hour will he be asleep  .

wilt thou destroy him then  ?
will you kill him then  ?
ay  , on mine honor  .

come on  , trinculo  , let us sing  .

that 's not the tune i had in mind  .
what is this same  ?
what 's this song  ?
this is the tune of our catch  , played by the picture of nobody  .
that 's the melody  , played by nobody  .
if thou beest a man  , show thyself in thy likeness  .
if you 're a man  , then let us see what you look like  .
if thou beest a devil  , take 't as thou list  .
if you 're a devil  , then go to hell  .
o  , forgive me my sins  !
oh  , forgive all my sins  !
he that dies pays all debts  .
dead men have to pay their debts  .
i defy thee  !
i challenge you  !

no  , monster  , not i  .
no  , monster  , not me  .
this will prove a brave kingdom to me  , where i shall have my music for nothing  .
this 'll be a wonderful kingdom to live in  , where they play music for free  .

as soon as you kill prospero  .
that shall be by and by  .
that 'll happen soon enough  .
i remember the story  .

by your patience  , i needs must rest me  .
if you do n't mind  , i need to rest a bit  .
sebastian i am right glad that he 's so out of hope  .
sebastian i 'm glad he 's so depressed  .

sebastian let it be tonight  , for now they are oppressed with travel  .
sebastian let 's do it tonight  .
they will not  , nor can not  , use such vigilance as when they are fresh  .
the men are so tired from traveling that they ca n't be as careful as they are when they 're fresh  .
antonio i say  , tonight  .
antonio yes  , tonight  .

a living drollery  .
a puppet show in real life  .
now i will believe that there are unicorns  , that in arabia there is one tree  , the phoenix ' throne  , one phoenix at this hour reigning there  .
now i 'll believe that unicorns exist  , and that there 's a tree in arabia where the phoenix lives  .
if in naples i should report this now  , would they believe me  ?
if i told them about this back in naples  , would they believe me  ?
if i should say  , i saw such islanders for  , certes  , these are people of the island who  , though they are of monstrous shape  , yet note  , their manners are more gentle - kind than of our human generation you shall find many nay  , almost any  .
i 'd tell them that i saw natives like these since they must be natives who are graceful and well - mannered even if they 're monstrous to look at  , kinder than most human beings you might find kinder than almost any human  .
honest lord  , thou hast said well  , for some of you there present are worse than devils  .
my good lord  , you 're absolutely right  , since some of you are worse than devils  .
i can not too much muse such shapes  , such gesture  , and such sound  , expressing  , although they want the use of tongue  , a kind of excellent dumb discourse  .
i ca n't stop being amazed by these shapes  , sounds  , and gestures  , which express  , even without saying anything  , a wonderful kind of silent language  .
praise in departing  .
time to go  .
they vanished strangely  .
they vanished strangely  .
no matter  , since they have left their viands behind  , for we have stomachs  .
it 's all right  , since they left their food behind  , and we 're hungry  .
will 't please you taste of what is here  ?
would you like to taste the banquet  ?
not i  .
not me  .
i will stand to and feed  , although my last  .
i 'll start eating  , even if this is my last supper  .
no matter  , since i feel the best is past  .
it 's all right  , since the best part of my life was over anyway  .
brother  , my lord the duke  , stand to and do as we  .
brother  , duke  , please have some food  .
bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou performed  , my ariel  .
you 've played the role of harpy very well  , my ariel  .
a grace it had  , devouring  .
you were fierce but graceful  .
of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say  .
you said everything i told you to say  .
so with good life and observation strange  , my meaner ministers their several kinds have done  .
in the same lifelike way  , and with the same attention to detail  , my lower - ranking servants have done what they were supposed to do  .
my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions  .
my magic powers are all in full swing  , and my enemies are confused and running around in circles  .
they now are in my power  , and in these fits i leave them while i visit young ferdinand  , whom they suppose is drowned  , and his and mine loved darling  .
they 're under my control  , and i 'm keeping them in their crazy fits while i go visit ferdinand  , whom they think has drowned  , and the young woman he and i both love  .
alonso i ' th ' name of something holy  , sir  , why stand you in this strange stare  ?
alonso for the love of god  , sir  , why are you standing here staring into space like this  ?
but one fiend at a time  , i 'll fight their legions o'er  .
i 'll fight every one of these devils if i have to  , one at a time  .
i 'll be thy second  .
i 'll back you up  .
all three of them are desperate  .
all three of them are crazy with despair  .
their great guilt  , like poison given to work a great time after  , now 'gins to bite the spirits  .
their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them  , like a slow - acting poison  .
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints  , follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them to  .
those of you who are young and active  , i beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do  .
follow  , i pray you  .
follow them  , please  .
i do believe it against an oracle  .
i 'd believe it even if told me differently  .
then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased  , take my daughter  .
then take my daughter  , both as my gift to you and as something you have earned  .
but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered  , no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow  , but barren hate  , sour - eyed disdain  , and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both  .
but if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place  , the heavens will not bless your relationship  , but will overwhelm you with hate  , contempt  , and discord  , and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it  .
therefore take heed  , as hymen 's lamps shall light you  .
so be careful  , and make sure you respect the holy institution of marriage  .
fairly spoke  .
you 've said it well  .
sit then and talk with her  .
so have a seat and talk to her  .
she is thine own  .

ferdinand look thou be true  .
ferdinand make sure you behave honorably  .
do not give dalliance too much the rein  .

the strongest oaths are straw to th ' fire i ' th ' blood  .
if you let yourself get stirred up  , you 'll forget your promise of good behavior  .
be more abstemious  , or else  , goodnight your vow  .
calm yourself down or you 'll forget your vow  .
i warrant you  , sir  , the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardor of my liver  .

i met venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on paphos  , in a carriage pulled by doves  .
here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and maid  , whose vows are that no bed - right shall be paid till hymen 's torch be lighted but in vain  .
they were planning to pull a mischievous trick on ferdinand and miranda  , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day  .

say again  , where didst thou leave these varlets  ?
tell me again  , where did you leave those lowlifes  ?
i told you  , sir  , they were red - hot with drinking  , so full of valor that they smote the air for breathing in their faces  , beat the ground for kissing of their feet yet always bending towards their project  .
i told you  , sir  , they were totally drunk  , so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces  , and beating the ground for touching their feet yet even when drunk  , they kept their plan firmly in mind  .
then i beat my tabor  , at which  , like unbacked colts  , they pricked their ears  , advanced their eyelids  , lifted up their noses as they smelt music  .
then i beat my drum  , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes  , looking around for the source of my music  .
so i charmed their ears that  , calflike  , they my lowing followed through toothed briers  , sharp furzes  , pricking gorse  , and thorns  , which entered their frail shins  .
i enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins  .
at last i left them i ' th ' filthy - mantled pool beyond your cell  , there dancing up to th ' chins  , that the foul lake o'erstunk their feet  .
in the end i left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room  , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins  .

my plans are almost at their climax  .
my charms crack not  , my spirits obey  , and time goes upright with his carriage  .
my spells are working well  , my spirits are obeying me  , and everything is right on schedule  .

what time is it  ?
on the sixth hour  , at which time  , my lord  , you said our work should cease  .
it 's after six o'clock  , my lord  , when you said our work would be finished  .
i did say so when first i raised the tempest  .
that 's what i said when i first conjured the tempest  .
say  , my spirit  , how fares the king and 's followers  ?

confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge  , just as you left them  , all prisoners  , sir  , in the line grove which weather - fends your cell  .
all cooped up together  , just as you ordered  , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather  .
they can not budge till your release  .
they ca n't move till you release them  .
the king  , his brother  , and yours  , abide all three distracted  , and the remainder mourning over them  , brimful of sorrow and dismay  .
the king  , his brother  , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind  , and the rest are grieving over them  , sad and astonished  .
but chiefly him that you termed  , sir  , the good old lord gonzalo  , his tears run down his beard like winter 's drops from eaves of reeds  .
good old lord gonzalo  , as you call him  , is saddest of all  , with tears running down his beard  .
your charm so strongly works 'em that if you now beheld them  , your affections would become tender  .
your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now  , you 'd feel sorry for them  .
dost thou think so  , spirit  ?
do you think so  , spirit  ?
mine would  , sir  , were i human  .

with his own lightning bolts  ; i 've shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars  ; i 've opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them  , letting them out with my powerful magic  .
but this rough magic i here abjure  , and when i have required some heavenly music  , which even now i do  , to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for  , i 'll break my staff  , bury it certain fathoms in the earth  , and deeper than did ever plummet sound i 'll drown my book  .
but i surrender all this magic now  , when i 've summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell  , as i 'm doing now  , i 'll break my staff and bury it far underground  , and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank  .
a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains  , now useless  , boiled within thy skull  .
let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds  , which are now useless  , seething inside your skulls  .
there stand  , for you are spell - stopped  .
all of you stand there in my spell  .
gonzalo holy gonzalo  , honorable man  , mine eyes  , ev'n sociable to the show of thine  , fall fellowly drops  .
gonzalo good gonzalo  , you honorable man  , my eyes weep for you  , since i feel what you must feel now  .
the charm dissolves apace  , and as the morning steals upon the night  , melting the darkness  , so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason  .
the spell is breaking gradually  , and just as dawn creeps in and melts away the darkness  , they will slowly return to their senses  .
gonzalo o good gonzalo  , my true preserver and a loyal sir
gonzalo oh  , my dear gonzalo  , you 're my savior and loyal to your lord  , i 'll reward you fully  , not just with praise but with actions too  .

what shall we do else  ?
why not  ?
were we not born under taurus  ?
were n't we both born under taurus  ?
taurus  !

that 's sides and heart  .
that governs the torso and heart  , does n't it  ?
no  , sir  , it is legs and thighs  .
no  , the legs and thighs  .
let me see the caper  .
let me see you dance  .

sir andrew ha  , higher  !
ha  , ha  , excellent  !
ha  , ha  , excellent  !
if the duke continue these favors towards you  , cesario  , you are like to be much advanced  .
if the duke keeps treating you so well  , cesario  , you 'll go far  .
he hath known you but three days  , and already you are no stranger  .
he 's only known you for three days  , but he 's already treating you like a close friend  .
you either fear his humor or my negligence  , that you call in question the continuance of his love  .
when you wonder whether he 'll keep treating me well  , it makes me think his mood might change or else i 'll mess up somehow  .
is he inconstant  , sir  , in his favors  ?
do his feelings toward people change suddenly  ?
no  , believe me  .
no  , not at all  .
i thank you  .
thanks for telling me  .
here comes the count  .
here comes the duke now  .
who saw cesario  , ho  ?
has anyone seen cesario  ?
on your attendance  , my lord  , here  .
i 'm right here  , my lord  , at your service  .
sure  , my noble lord  , if she be so abandoned to her sorrow as it is spoke  , she never will admit me  .
but my lord  , i 'm sure that if she 's as depressed as people say  , she 'll never let me in  .
i think not so  , my lord  .
i do n't think so  , my lord  .
let her hang me  .
so let her execute me  .
he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors  .
anyone who 's executed does n't have to be afraid of anything he sees  .
make that good  .
how do you know  ?
he shall see none to fear  .
well  , he 'll be dead  , so he wo n't see anything  .
a good lenten answer  .
that 's a lame answer  .
i can tell thee where that saying was born  , of i fear no colors  .
by the way  , i know where you get all your brave talk about not being afraid of anything  .
where  , good mistress mary  ?
where  , good miss mary  ?
well  , god give them wisdom that have it  .
well  , we all have our special gifts  .
and those that are fools  , let them use their talents  .
some people are born wise  ; those of us who were meant to be fools should do what they do best  .
you are resolute  , then  ?
you 've made up your mind  , then  ?
not so  , neither  , but i am resolved on two points  .
no  , but i 've made up my mind on two points  .
that if one break  , the other will hold  .
ah yes  , the two points where your suspenders are attached to your buttons  .
or  , if both break  , your gaskins fall  .
if one breaks  , the other will hold  , but if both points break  , your pants will fall down  .
apt  , in good faith  , very apt  .
clever  , very clever  .
well  , go thy way  .
well  , go along now  .
if sir toby would leave drinking  , thou wert as witty a piece of eve 's flesh as any in illyria  .
you 'd be the funniest person in illyria if sir toby ever stopped drinking  .

here comes my lady  .

besides  , you grow dishonest  .
besides  , you 've gotten unreliable  .
sir  , i bade them take away you  .

can you do it  ?
can you do that  ?
dexterously  , good madonna  .
easily  , madam  .

then go ahead and prove it  .
i must catechise you for it  , madonna  .
i 'll have to ask you some questions  , madam  .
good my mouse of virtue  , answer me  .
please answer  , my good little student  .
well  , sir  , for want of other idleness  , i 'll bide your proof  .
i 'm listening to you only because i 've got nothing better to do  .
good madonna  , why mournest thou  ?
my dear madam  , why are you in mourning  ?
good fool  , for my brother 's death  .
my dear fool  , because my brother died  .
i think his soul is in hell  , madonna  .
i think his soul 's in hell  , my lady  .
i know his soul is in heaven  , fool  .
i know his soul 's in heaven  , fool  .
the more fool  , madonna  , to mourn for your brother 's soul being in heaven  .
then you 're a fool for being sad that your brother 's soul is in heaven  .
take away the fool  , gentlemen  .
take away this fool  , gentlemen  .
what think you of this fool  , malvolio  ?
what do you think of this fool  , malvolio  ?
doth he not mend  ?
is n't he getting funnier  ?
yes  , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him  .
yes  , and he 'll keep getting funnier till he dies  .
infirmity  , that decays the wise  , doth ever make the better fool  .
old age always makes people act funny even wise people  , but fools more than anybody  .
god send you  , sir  , a speedy infirmity  , for the better increasing your folly  !
i hope you go senile soon  , sir  , so you can become a more foolish fool  !
sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox  , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool  .
sir toby would bet a fortune that i 'm not smart  , but he would n't bet two cents that you 're not a fool  .
how say you to that  , malvolio  ?
what do you say to that  , malvolio  ?
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal  .
i 'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker  .
i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
the other day i saw him defeated in a
has no more brain than a stone  .
battle of wits by an ordinary jester with no more brains than a rock  .
look you now  , he 's out of his guard already  .
look at him  , he 's at a loss for words already  .
unless you laugh and minister occasion to him  , he is gagged  .
unless he 's got somebody laughing at him  , he ca n't think of anything to say  .
i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies  .
i swear  , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester 's apprentice  .

the first drink makes him a fool  , the second makes him crazy  , and the third drowns him  .
madam  , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you  .
madam  , that young man out there says he 's got to speak to you  .
i told him you were sick  .
i told him you were sick  .
he takes on him to understand so much  , and therefore comes to speak with you  .
he claimed he knew that  , and that 's why he 's come to speak with you  .
i told him you were asleep  .
i told him you were asleep  .
he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too  , and therefore comes to speak with you  .
he claimed to know that already too  , and said that 's the reason he 's come to speak with you  .
what is to be said to him  , lady  ?
what can i say to him  , lady  ?
he 's fortified against any denial  .
he 's got an answer for everything  .
tell him he shall not speak with me  .
tell him he 's not going to speak with me  .
what kind o ' man is he  ?
what kind of man is he  ?
why  , of mankind  .
just a man  , like any other  .
what manner of man  ?

olivia we 'll once more hear orsino 's embassy  .
olivia we 're going to hear orsino 's pleas again  .
the honorable lady of the house  , which is she  ?
which one of you is the lady of the house  ?

you can speak to me  .
i shall answer for her  .
i represent her  .
your will  ?
what do you want  ?
most radiant  , exquisite and unmatchable beauty i pray you  , tell me if this be the lady of the house  , for i never saw her  .
what stunning  , exquisite  , and unmatchable beauty but please  , tell me if you 're the lady of the house  , because i 've never seen her  .
i would be loath to cast away my speech  , for besides that it is excellently well penned  , i have taken great pains to con it  .
i 'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person  , because it 's very well written and i spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it  .
good beauties  , let me sustain no scorn  .
beautiful ladies  , please do n't treat me badly  .
i am very comptible  , even to the least sinister usage  .
i 'm very sensitive  , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings  .
whence came you  , sir  ?
where do you come from  , sir  ?
i can say little more than i have studied  , and that question 's out of my part  .
i 'm sorry  , but i memorized what i 'm supposed to say here today  , and that question is n't part of the speech i learned  .
good gentle one  , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house  , that i may proceed in my speech  .
please  , my lady  , just confirm that you 're the lady of the house so i can get on with my speech  .
are you a comedian  ?
are you an actor  ?
no  , my profound heart  .

are you the lady of the house  ?
are you the lady of the house  ?
if i do not usurp myself  , i am  .
i am  , unless i somehow stole this role  .
most certain  , if you are she  , you do usurp yourself  , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve  .
if you 're the lady of the house  , then it 's true you 're stealing your role  , because what 's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself  .
but this is from my commission  .
but that 's not part of what i 'm supposed to say  .
i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message  .
i 'll go on with my speech praising you  , and then i 'll get to the point  .
come to what is important in 't  .
get to the point now  .
i forgive you the praise  .
i 'll let you get away with skipping the praise  .
alas  , i took great pains to study it  , and 't is poetical  .
that 's too bad  , because i spent a long time memorizing it  , and it 's poetic  .

my lady  , would you mind asking your giant here to back off a bit  ?
tell me your mind  .
tell me what you want  .
i am a messenger  .
i have a message to deliver  .
sure  , you have some hideous matter to deliver  , when the courtesy of it is so fearful  .
it must be a message about something horrible  , since you deliver it so rudely  .
speak your office  .
tell me what it 's about  .
yet you began rudely  .
but you began so rudely  .
what are you  ?
who are you  ?
what would you  ?
what do you want  ?
give us the place alone  .
everyone  , please leave us alone for a moment  .
we will hear this divinity  .
i 've got a sacred secret to hear  .

wind and rain ca n't wash it off  .
how does he love me  ?
how does he love me  ?
in voices well divulged  , free  , learned  , and valiant  ; and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person  .
but i just ca n't love him  .
but yet i can not love him  ; he might have took his answer long ago  .
he should have resigned himself to that a long time ago  .
why  , what would you  ?
what would you do about it  ?
you might do much  .
not bad  ; you might accomplish something  .
what is your parentage  ?
who are your parents  ?

i can not love him  .
i ca n't love him  .

tell him not to send any more messengers unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news  .
fare you well  .
goodbye  .
i thank you for your pains  .

i am no fee 'd post  , lady  .
i 'm not a paid messenger  , my lady  .
keep your purse  .
keep your money  .
my master  , not myself  , lacks recompense  .
it 's my master who 's not getting the reward he deserves  , not me  .
love make his heart of flint that you shall love  , and let your fervor  , like my master 's  , be placed in contempt  .
i hope you fall in love with a man whose heart is hard as a rock and who treats your love like a big joke  , just like you 've done  .
farewell  , fair cruelty  .

if that young man comes here again tomorrow  , i 'll tell him why  .

i 'm sorry i was n't a better host for you  , sir  .
o good antonio  , forgive me your trouble  .
oh  , antonio  , i 'm sorry i caused you so much trouble  .
if you will not undo what you have done that is  , kill him whom you have recovered desire it not  .
if you do n't want to break my heart  , then say goodbye to me right now  .
fare you well at once  .
i like you very much  .
my bosom is full of kindness  , and i am yet so near the manners of my mother  , that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me  .
i 'm really about to cry  , just like my mother would do  .
i am bound to the count orsino 's court  .
i 'm going to count orsino 's court  .

come  , sir  , you peevishly threw it to her  , and her will is it should be so returned  .
you threw it at her rudely  , and she wants you to take it back  .
if it be worth stooping for  , there it lies in your eye  .
if it 's worth bending over to pick up  , there it is on the ground  , where you can see it  .
if not  , be it his that finds it  .
if not  , whoever finds it can have it  .
i left no ring with her  .
i did n't give her any ring  .
what means this lady  ?
what 's she trying to say  ?
fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her  !
i hope she does n't have a crush on me  !
she made good view of me  , indeed so much that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue  , for she did speak in starts distractedly  .
it 's true she looked at me a lot  , in fact  , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted  , and could n't really finish her sentences very well  .
she loves me  , sure  !
oh  , i really think she loves me  !
the cunning of her passion invites me in this churlish messenger  .
she sent this rude messenger to tell me to come back  , instead of coming herself  , which would be indis -

maria  , bring us some wine  !
mistress mary  , if you prized my lady 's favor at anything more than contempt  , you would not give means for this uncivil rule  .
miss mary  , if you cared what lady olivia thinks about you at all  , you would n't contribute to this rude behavior  .
she shall know of it  , by this hand  .
i assure you  , she 'll find out about this  .
go shake your ears  !
go and wiggle your ears  !
do 't  , knight  .
do that  .
i 'll write thee a challenge  .
i 'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf  .
or i 'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth  .
or i 'll deliver your insults to his face  .
marry  , sir  , sometimes he is a kind of puritan  .
well  , sometimes he acts like a goody two shoes  .
o  , if i thought that  , i 'd beat him like a dog  !
oh  , i 'll beat him up for that  !
what  , for being a puritan  ?
you 're going to beat him up for being good  ?
thy exquisite reason  , dear knight  ?
and what 's your brilliant reason for that  , please  ?
i have no exquisite reason for 't  , but i have reason good enough  .
i do n't have any brilliant reason for it  , but i have a good enough reason  .
what wilt thou do  ?
what are you going to do  ?
i can write very like my lady your niece  : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands  .
and i ca n't tell the difference between each other 's handwriting  .
excellent  !
excellent  !
i smell a device  .
sounds like you 've got a good trick in mind  .
i have 't in my nose too  .
i like it too  .
he shall think  , by the letters that thou wilt drop  , that they come from my niece  , and that she 's in love with him  .
he 'll think these letters are from olivia and that she 's in love with him  .
my purpose is  , indeed  , a horse of that color  .
yes  , that 's the idea  .
and your horse now would make him an ass  .
he 's going to look like a total idiot  .
ass  , i doubt not  .
absolutely  , you idiot  .
oh  , 'twill be admirable  !
this is going to be great  !
sport royal  , i warrant you  .
it 's going to be fun  , i promise  .
i know my physic will work with him  .
i know my medicine will work on him  .
i will plant you two  , and let the fool make a third  , where he shall find the letter  .
i 'll have you two hide and the fool too right where he 'll find the letter  .
observe his construction of it  .
watch his reaction  .
for this night  , to bed  , and dream on the event  .
meanwhile  , let 's go to bed and dream about this  .
farewell  .
good night  .
good night  , penthesilea  .
good night  , you amazing woman  , you  .
before me  , she 's a good wench  .
she 's a fine woman  , all right  .
she 's a beagle  , true - bred  , and one that adores me  .
she 's a good little woman  , and she adores me  .
what o ' that  ?
what about it  ?
i was adored once too  .
someone adored me once  , too  .
let 's to bed  , knight  .
let 's go to bed  , knight  .
thou hadst need send for more money  .
tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you  .
if i can not recover your niece  , i am a foul way out  .
if i ca n't persuade your niece to marry me  , i 'm going to be in some serious financial trouble  .
send for money  , knight  .
get your hands on some money and everything will be all right  .
if thou hast her not i ' the end  , call me cut  .
i know you 'll win over olivia in the end  .
if i do not  , never trust me  , take it how you will  .
i know i will too  , if it 's the last thing i do  .
he is not here  , so please your lordship  , that should sing it  .
sir  , the person who should sing that song is n't here  .
who was it  ?
who was it  ?
it gives a very echo to the seat where love is throned  .
it really makes you feel what a lover feels  .
thou dost speak masterly  .
you 're absolutely right  .
my life upon 't  , young though thou art  , thine eye hath stay 'd upon some favor that it loves  .
i 'd bet my life that  , as young as you are  , you 've fallen in love with someone  .
hath it not  , boy  ?
have n't you  , boy  ?
a little  , by your favor  .
a little bit  .
what kind of woman is't  ?
what kind of woman is she  ?
of your complexion  .
she 's a lot like you  .
she is not worth thee  , then  .
she 's not good enough for you  , then  .
what years  , i ' faith  ?
how old is she  ?
about your years  , my lord  .
about as old as you are  , my lord  .
too old by heaven  .
that 's definitely too old  .
let still the woman take an elder than herself  .
a woman should always pick an older man  .
so wears she to him  , so sways she level in her husband 's heart  .
that way she 'll adjust herself to what her husband wants  , and the husband will be happy and faithful to her  .
for  , boy  , however we do praise ourselves  , our fancies are more giddy and unfirm  , more longing  , wavering  , sooner lost and worn  , than women 's are  .
because however much we like to brag  , boy  , the truth is that we men change our minds a lot more than women do  , and our desires come and go a lot faster than theirs  .
i think it well  , my lord  .
i think you 're right  , sir  .
then let thy love be younger than thyself  , or thy affection can not hold the bent  .
so find someone younger to love  , or you wo n't be able to maintain your feelings  .
for women are as roses  , whose fair flower being once displayed  , doth fall that very hour  .
women are like roses  : the moment their beauty is in full bloom  , it 's about to decay  .
and so they are  .
that 's true  .
alas  , that they are so  , to die even when they to perfection grow  !
it 's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection  !
are you ready  , sir  ?
are you ready  , sir  ?
there 's for thy pains  .
fool here 's some money for your trouble  .
no pains  , sir  .
no trouble  , sir  .
i take pleasure in singing  , sir  .
i like singing  .
i 'll pay thy pleasure then  .
then i 'll pay you for doing what you like  .
give me now leave to leave thee  .
you may leave  .
let all the rest give place  .
all the rest of you can leave too  .
but if she can not love you  , sir  ?
but if she ca n't love you  , sir  ?
i can not be so answer 'd  .
i refuse to accept that  .
ay  , but i know
yes  , but i know
what dost thou know  ?
what do you know  ?
too well what love women to men may owe  .
i know a lot about the love women can feel for men  .
in faith  , they are as true of heart as we  .
actually  , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are  .
my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be  , perhaps  , were i a woman  , i should your lordship  .
my father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that i might love you  , if i were a woman  .
and what 's her history  ?
and what 's her story  ?
but died thy sister of her love  , my boy  ?
but did your sister die of love  ?
i am all the daughters of my father 's house  , and all the brothers too and yet i know not  .
i am the only daughter in my father 's family  , and all the brothers too but i 'm not completely sure about that  .
sir  , shall i to this lady  ?
anyway  , sir  , should i go see the lady  ?
come thy ways  , signior fabian  .
come along with us  , signor fabian  .
nay  , i 'll come  .
i 'm coming  , do n't worry  .
if i lose a scruple of this sport  , let me be boiled to death with melancholy  .
if i miss this  , let me be boiled alive  .
wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep - biter come by some notable shame  ?
wo n't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated  ?
i would exult  , man  .
i 'll be thrilled  .
you know  , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear - baiting here  .
you know  , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when i arranged a bear - baiting here  .
to anger him  , we 'll have the bear again  , and we will fool him black and blue  .
we 'll have another bear - baiting just to make him angry  , and we 'll mock him till he 's black and blue  .
shall we not  , sir andrew  ?
wo n't we  , sir andrew  ?
an we do not  , it is pity of our lives  .
if we do n't  , it 'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives  .
here comes the little villain  .
here comes the little villain herself  .
how now  , my metal of india  ?
how are you  , my golden girl  ?
 (  ) here 's an overweening rogue  !
what an egomaniac  !
o  , peace  !
shh  !
contemplation makes a rare turkey - cock of him  .
when he 's alone with his thoughts  , he 's even more like a haughty peacock  .
how he jets under his advanced plumes  !
watch him strut  !
 (  ) 'slight  , i could so beat the rogue  !
i swear  , i 'd like to beat the jerk so hard  !
 (  ) peace  , i say  .
be quiet  !
to be count malvolio  !
just think  , i could be count malvolio  !
 (  ) ah  , rogue  !
ah  , what a jerk  !
 (  ) pistol him  , pistol him  .
shoot him  , just shoot him  .
 (  ) peace  , peace  !
shh  , shh  !
there is example for 't  .
after all  , it would n't be the first time that kind of thing has happened  .
the lady of the strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe  .
lady strachy married her wardrobe manager  .
 (  ) fie on him  , jezebel  !
damn him  , the arrogant fool  !
o  , peace  !
shh  !
now he 's deeply in  .
we 've got him right where we want him  .
look how imagination blows him  .
he 's on a big ego trip  .
having been three months married to her  , sitting in my state
just think of me  , having been married to her for three months  , sitting around majestically
 (  ) oh  , for a stone - bow  , to hit him in the eye  !
if only i had a slingshot so i could hit him in the eye  !
calling my officers about me  , in my branched velvet gown  , having come from a daybed  , where i have left olivia sleeping
calling my servants together  , wearing an embroidered robe  , having just come from a couch where i 've left olivia sleeping
 (  ) fire and brimstone  !
that does it  !
 (  ) o  , peace  , peace  !
oh  , be quiet  , be quiet  !
 (  ) bolts and shackles  !
that really does it  !
 (  ) o peace  , peace  , peace  !
oh  , quiet  , quiet  !
now  , now  .
please  , please  .
 (  ) shall this fellow live  ?
are we going to let this guy live  ?
though our silence be drawn from us with cars  , yet peace  .
yes  , we have to be quiet  , even if it 's torture  .
i extend my hand to him thus  , quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control
i reach out my hand to him like this  , giving him a stern look instead of my usual friendly smile
 (  ) and does not toby take you a blow o ' the lips then  ?
and then does n't toby punch you in the mouth  ?
saying  , cousin toby  , my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech
and i 'd say to him  , cousin toby  , since i 've been lucky enough to marry your niece  , i have the right to say a few things to you
 (  ) what  , what  ?
oh yeah  , like what  ?
you must amend your drunkenness  .
you must stop being such a drunk  .
 (  ) out  , scab  !
get out of here  , you scab  !
 (  ) nay  , patience  , or we break the sinews of our plot  .
no  , be quiet  , or we 'll screw up the joke  .
besides  , you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight
and you 're wasting your time with that foolish knight
 (  ) that 's me  , i warrant you  .
that 's me  , i bet  .
one sir andrew
that sir andrew
 (  ) what employment have we here  ?
 (  ) what 's this  ?
 (  ) now is the woodcock near the gin  .
he 's taking the bait  .
o  , peace  !
shhh  !
and the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him  !
i hope he reads it out loud  , to make it funnier  !
 (  ) her c 's  , her u 's and her t 's  .
her c 's  , her u 's  , and her t 's  .
why that  ?
why focus on that  ?
to the unknown beloved  , this  , and my good wishes her very phrases  !
to my dear beloved who does n't know i love him  , i send you this letter with all my heart that 's exactly how she talks  !
by your leave  , wax  .

and the impressure her lucrece  , with which she uses to seal  .
this is the stamp my lady seals her letters with it has a picture of lucrece on it  .
't is my lady  .
this letter is from olivia  .
to whom should this be  ?
who is this written to  ?
 (  ) this wins him  , liver and all  .
this 'll get him  .
no man must know  .
no man must know  .
what follows  ?
what comes after that  ?
the numbers altered  .
look  , the meter changes in her poem  .
no man must know  .
no man must know  .
if this should be thee  , malvolio  ?

i  .
doth sway my life  .

nay  , but first  , let me see  , let me see  , let me see  .
hmm  , let me see  , let me see  , let me see  .
 (  ) what dish o ' poison has she dressed him  !
what a dish of poison she 's mixed for him  !
 (  ) and with what wing the staniel checks at it  !
and look how willingly he 's taking the bait  .
 (  ) o  , ay  , make up that  .
oh  , bad dog  .
he is now at a cold scent  .
he 's losing the scent  !
sowter will cry upon 't for all this  , though it be as rank as a fox  .
he 'll find it again  , no matter how much it stinks  .
m malvolio  .
m malvolio  .
m why  , that begins my name  .
m why  , that 's the first letter in my name  .
did not i say he would work it out  ?
did n't i tell you he 'd figure it out  ?
the cur is excellent at faults  .
this dog 's excellent at following false leads  .
 (  ) and o shall end  , i hope  .
and an o like a noose will end this  , i hope  .
 (  ) ay  , or i 'll cudgel him and make him cry o  !
yeah  , or i 'll beat him up and make him yell oh  !
and then i comes behind  .
and then the i comes next  .
ay  , an you had any eye behind you  , you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you  .
if you had an i in the back of your head  , you 'd see trouble behind you  .
if this fall into thy hand  , revolve  .
if this letter falls into your hands  , think carefully about what it says  .
in my stars i am above thee  , but be not afraid of greatness  .
by my birth i rank above you  , but do n't be afraid of my greatness  .
some are born great  , some achieve greatness  , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em  .
some are born great  , some achieve greatness  , and some have greatness thrust upon them  .
thy fates open their hands  .
your fate awaits you  .
let thy blood and spirit embrace them  .
accept it in body and spirit  .
and  , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be  , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh  .
to get used to the life you 'll most likely be leading soon  , get rid of your low - class trappings  .
be opposite with a kinsman  , surly with servants  .
show some eagerness for the new upscale lifestyle that 's waiting
thou canst not choose but know who i am  .
you must have figured out who i am  .
if thou entertainest my love  , let it appear in thy smiling  .
if you love me  , let me know by smiling at me  .
thy smiles become thee well  .
you 're so attractive when you smile  .
therefore in my presence still smile  , dear my sweet  , i prithee  .
please smile whenever you 're near me  , my dearest darling  .
i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy  .
i would n't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds  , to be paid by the shah of persia  .
i could marry this wench for this device  .
i could marry that maria for thinking this up  .
so could i too  .
so could i  .
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest  .
and i would n't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one  .
nor i neither  .
neither would i  .
here comes my noble gull - catcher  .
here she comes  , the brilliant fool - catcher  .
wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck  ?
may i kiss your feet  ?
or o ' mine either  ?
and i too  ?
shall i play my freedom at tray - trip  , and become thy bondslave  ?
shall i be your slave  ?
i ' faith  , or i either  ?
me too  .
why  , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad  .
you 've made him so delusional he 'll go crazy when he learns the truth  .
nay  , but say true  , does it work upon him  ?
did it really work  ?
like aqua vitae with a midwife  .
like medicine for a sick man  .
if you will then see the fruits of the sport  , mark his first approach before my lady  .
if you want to really have some fun  , watch him next time he 's near lady olivia  .
he will come to her in yellow stockings  , and 't is a color she abhors  , and cross - gartered  , a fashion she detests  .
he 'll show up in yellow stockings she hates yellow and with laces crisscrossing up his legs she hates that style of dress and he 'll smile  , which will go completely against her mood  , since she 's addicted to sadness now  .
and he will smile upon her  , which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition  , being addicted to a melancholy as she is  , that it can not but turn him into a notable contempt  .
she 'll definitely get upset with him  .
if you will see it  , follow me  .
if you want to watch  , follow me  .
to the gates of tartar  , thou most excellent devil of wit  !
i 'd follow you to the gates of hell  , you sneaky little devil  !
i 'll make one too  .
i 'll come too  .
save thee  , friend  , and thy music  .
god bless you  , my friend  , and your music too  .
dost thou live by thy tabour  ?
do you make your living by playing that drum  ?
no  , sir  , i live by the church  .
no  , sir  , i live by the church  .
art thou a churchman  ?
oh  , you 're a clergyman  ?
so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him  , or the church stands by thy tabor  , if thy tabor stand by the church  .
you could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him  , or that the church is supported by your drum because it stands by your drum  .
nay  , that 's certain  .
that 's true  .
they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton  .
people who fool around with words too much can make words act like whores changing all the time  , and immoral too  .
i would therefore my sister had no name  , sir  .
that 's why i wish my sister did n't have a name  , sir  .
why  , man  ?
why  , man  ?
why  , sir  , her name 's a word  , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton  .
well  , her name 's a word  , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore  .
but  , indeed  , words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them  .
but  , you know  , words have been rascals ever since people started using written contracts rather than their word of honor  .
thy reason  , man  ?
why do you say that  ?
troth  , sir  , i can yield you none without words  , and words are grown so false  , i am loath to prove reason with them  .
honestly  , sir  , i 'd need to use words to explain why  , and since words are so unreliable and false  , i 'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion  .
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing  .
i bet you 're a happy fellow who does n't care about anything  .
not so  , sir  , i do care for something  .
you 're wrong  , sir  , i do care about something  .
but in my conscience  , sir  , i do not care for you  .
but i 'll admit i do n't care for you  .
if that be to care for nothing  , sir  , i would it would make you invisible  .
if that means i do n't care about anything  , you should disappear right now  , since you 're nothing  .
art not thou the lady olivia 's fool  ?
are n't you lady olivia 's fool  ?
i saw thee late at the count orsino 's  .
i saw you at count orsino 's recently  .
nay  , an thou pass upon me  , i 'll no more with thee  .
oh no  , if you 're joking around with me  , i 'm leaving  .
hold  , there 's expenses for thee  .
wait  , here 's a coin for you  .
now jove  , in his next commodity of hair  , send thee a beard  !
next time god sends out a shipment of hair  , i hope he gives you a beard  !
would not a pair of these have bred  , sir  ?
if i had two of these coins  , do you think they 'd breed more coins  ?
yes  , being kept together and put to use  .
yes  , if you kept them together and invested them  .
i would play lord pandarus of phrygia  , sir  , to bring a cressida to this troilus  .
i 'd like to be like that famous pimp  , lord pandarus  , and get a  .
i understand you  , sir  .
fool i get what you 're driving at  , sir  .
't is well begged  .
you 're a very clever beggar  .
the matter  , i hope  , is not great  , sir  , begging but a beggar  .
it should n't be too much to ask  ; i 'm only begging for a beggar  .
cressida was a beggar  .
they say cressida became a beggar in her old age  .
my lady is within  , sir  .
my lady olivia 's inside  , sir  .
i will construe to them whence you come  .
i 'll tell them where you come from  , though i do n't know who you are or what you want  .
who you are and what you would are out of my welkin  , i might say element  , but the word is overworn  .
i 'd say i was out of my element  , but that phrase is overused  , so i 'll say i 'm out of my air  .
save you  , gentleman  .
hello  , sir  .
and you  , sir  .
hello to you too  , sir  .
i hope  , sir  , you are  , and i am yours  .
 (  ) oh  , good  , i am too  .
i am bound to your niece  , sir  .
i 'm headed for your niece  , sir  .
i mean  , she is the list of my voyage  .
she 's the reason i 'm here  .
taste your legs  , sir  .
taste your legs  , sir  .
put them to motion  .
please go inside  .
i mean  , to go  , sir  , to enter  .
i mean please go into the house  , sir  .
i will answer you with gait and entrance  .
i will  .
but we are prevented  .
but now we do n't have to  !
most excellent accomplished lady  , the heavens rain odors on you  !
oh  , beautiful and accomplished lady  , may the heavens rain odors upon you  !
 (  ) that youth 's a rare courtier  .
that young man 's classy  .
rain odors  .
rain odors  .
well  .
that 's good  .
odors  , pregnant  , and vouchsafed  .
odors  , willing  , and deserving  .
i 'll get 'em all three all ready  .
i 'll have to remember those words so i can use them later myself  .
let the garden door be shut  , and leave me to my hearing  .
close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message  .
give me your hand  , sir  .
give me your hand  , sir  .
my duty  , madam  , and most humble service  .
i give you my obedience and my humble service  , madam  .
what is your name  ?
what 's your name  ?
cesario is your servant 's name  , fair princess  .
cesario is my name your servant 's name fair princess  .
for him  , i think not on him  .
as for him  , i never think about him  .
for his thoughts  , would they were blanks  , rather than fill 'd with me  .
as for his thoughts  , i wish he 'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time  .
madam  , i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf  .
madam  , i 've come here to try to make you like him  .
o  , by your leave  , i pray you  , i bade you never speak again of him  .
oh  , please  , i 'm begging you  , do n't mention him again  .
but  , would you undertake another suit  , i had rather hear you to solicit that than music from the spheres  .
but if you want to tell me that someone else loves me  , i 'd enjoy hearing that more than i 'd enjoy listening to angels sing  .
dear lady
my dear lady
have you not set mine honor at the stake  , and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think  ?
have n't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger  ?
to one of your receiving enough is shown  .
for someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough  .
a cypress  , not a bosom  , hides my heart  .
i 'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  , and i ca n't hide my feelings  .
so  , let me hear you speak  .
so let me hear what you have to say  .
i pity you  .
i feel sorry for you  .
that 's a degree to love  .
that 's a step in the direction of love  .
no  , not a grize  .
no  , not at all  .
for 't is a vulgar proof that very oft we pity enemies  .
it 's a perfectly ordinary experience for us to feel sorry for our enemies  .
then westward ho  !
then west is where i 'm headed  !
grace and good disposition attend your ladyship  !
i wish you all the best  .
you 'll nothing  , madam  , to my lord by me  ?
you do
stay  , i prithee  , tell me what thou thinkest of me  .
stay  , please  , tell me what you think of me  .
that you do think you are not what you are  .
i think you 're denying what you really are  .
if i think so  , i think the same of you  .
if that 's true  , i think the same thing about you  .
i would you were as i would have you be  !
i wish you were what i wanted you to be  !
would it be better  , madam  , than i am  ?
would it be better if i were that  , instead of what i am  ?
i wish it might  , for now i am your fool  .
i wish i were something better  , because right now i 'm a big fool  .
by innocence i swear  , and by my youth i have one heart  , one bosom  , and one truth  , and that no woman has  , nor never none shall mistress be of it  , save i alone  .
and i swear by my youth and innocence that i 've only got one heart and one love to give  , and that i 've never given them to a woman and never will  .
and so adieu  , good madam  .
so goodbye  , my lady  .
nevermore will i my master 's tears to you deplore  .
i wo n't ever come to complain about my lord 's love for you again  .
no  , faith  , i 'll not stay a jot longer  .
no  , i wo n't stay a second longer  .
thy reason  , dear venom  , give thy reason  .
why are you leaving  , my angry friend  ?
you must needs yield your reason  , sir andrew  .
yes  , you have to tell us why  , sir andrew  .
marry  , i saw your niece do more favors to the count 's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me  .
well  , because i saw your niece olivia treat the count 's messenger better than she 's ever treated me  .
i saw 't i ' the orchard  .
i saw it in the orchard  .
did she see thee the while  , old boy  ?
did she see you there the whole time  , old boy  ?
tell me that  .
tell me that  .
as plain as i see you now  .
yes  , she saw me quite clearly  .
this was a great argument of love in her toward you  .
well  , that proves she 's in love with you  .
'slight  , will you make an ass o ' me  ?
are you trying to make fun of me  ?
i will prove it legitimate  , sir  , upon the oaths of judgment and reason  .
no  , i 'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument  .
and they have been grand - jurymen since before noah was a sailor  .
and you ca n't deny evidence and argument they 've been around since noah 's ark  .
she did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you  , to awake your dormouse valor  , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver  .
she flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you  , fire up your passions  , and make you angry and jealous  .
you should then have accosted her  , and with some excellent jests  , fire - new from the mint  , you should have banged the youth into dumbness  .
you should have run up to her  , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot  , and rendered the young man speechless  .
an 't be any way  , it must be with valor  , for policy i hate  .
i 'll have to do something courageous then  , because i hate intrigue  .
i had as lief be a brownist as a politician  .
i 'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots  .
why  , then  , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor  .
well then  , improve your situation with a show of courage  .
challenge me the count 's youth to fight with him  .
challenge the count 's young servant to a fight  .
hurt him in eleven places  .
hurt him in eleven different places  .
my niece shall take note of it  , and assure thyself  , there is no love - broker in the world can more prevail in man 's commendation with woman than report of valor  .
my niece olivia will notice  , and let me tell you  , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage  .
there is no way but this  , sir andrew  .
it 's really the only way  , sir andrew  .
will either of you bear me a challenge to him  ?
will either of you give him the message that i 'm challenging him to a duel  ?
where shall i find you  ?
where will i find you when i 've finished it  ?
we 'll call thee at the cubiculo  .
we 'll come find you in the bedroom  .
go  .
go on  .
this is a dear manikin to you  , sir toby  .
this precious little guy is putty in your hands  , sir toby  .
i have been dear to him  , lad  , some two thousand strong  , or so  .
he must like me  , since he 's let me spend two thousand of his ducats  .
and his opposite  , the youth  , bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty  .
and his opponent  , the young messenger  , does n't look like he 'd be very aggressive in a fight  .
look where the youngest wren of nine comes  .
here comes my little bird  .
and cross - gartered  ?
with crisscrossed laces  ?
come  , bring us  , bring us where he is  .
come on  , take us to him  .
my kind antonio  , i can no other answer make but thanks  , and thanks  , and ever thanks  .
my friend antonio  , all i can say is thank you  .
and oft good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay  .
i know words are cheap  .
but were my worth as is my conscience  , firm  , you should find better dealing  .
if i had any money i 'd back up my gratitude with cash  .
what 's to do  ?
anyway  , what should we do  ?
shall we go see the relics of this town  ?
should we go see the sights in the town  ?
tomorrow  , sir  .
we can do that tomorrow  , sir  .
best first go see your lodging  .
first we should make sure you have somewhere to stay  .
belike you slew great number of his people  ?
you probably killed a lot of his men  ?
do not then walk too open  .
then do n't make yourself too conspicuous  .
it doth not fit me  .
you 're right  .
hold  , sir  , here 's my purse  .
hang on a minute  , here 's some money for you  .
in the south suburbs  , at the elephant  , is best to lodge  .
sebastian the best place to stay around here is an inn called the elephant  , in the suburbs south of the city  .
i will bespeak our diet  , whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town  .
i 'll arrange for our meals while you enjoy yourself and educate yourself by looking at the town  .
there shall you have me  .
you 'll find me at the elephant  .
why i your purse  ?
why are you giving me your purse  ?
i 'll be your purse - bearer and leave you for an hour  .
i 'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour  .
to the elephant  .
we 'll meet at the elephant  .
i do remember  .
i remember  .
i have sent after him  .
i 've sent for him  .
he says he 'll come  .
he says he 'll come  .
how shall i feast him  ?
what kind of food should i serve him  ?
what bestow of him  ?
what presents should i give him  ?
for youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow 'd  .
it 's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them  .
i speak too loud  .
oh  , i 'm talking too loud  .
where 's malvolio  ?
where 's malvolio  ?
he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes  .
he 's very serious  , which is right for someone in mourning like me  .
where is malvolio  ?
where is malvolio  ?
he 's coming  , madam  ; but in very strange manner  .
he 's coming  , madam  ; but he 's acting very strangely  .

why  , what 's the matter  ?
why  , what 's the matter with him  ?
does he rave  ?
is he talking nonsense  ?
no  , madam  , he does nothing but smile  .
no  , he just smiles  .
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come  , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits  .
you should have a guard nearby if he comes in here  , because he 's clearly disturbed  .
go call him hither  .
ask him in here  .
i am as mad as he  , if sad and merry madness equal be  .
i 'm as crazy as he is  , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent  .

i sent for you about a sad occasion  .
sad  , lady  !
sad  , my lady  !
i could be sad  .
i could be sad if i wanted to be  .
this does make some obstruction in the blood  , this cross - gartering  , but what of that  ?
these crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit  , but who cares  ?
if it please the eye of one  , it is with me as the very true sonnet is  , please one  , and please all  .
as the sonnet says  , if you please one special person  , you please everyone who matters  .
why  , how dost thou  , man  ?
why  , what 's going on  ?
what is the matter with thee  ?
what 's the matter with you  ?
not black in my mind  , though yellow in my legs  .
my legs may be yellow  , but i do n't feel blue  .
it did come to his hands  , and commands shall be executed  .
it was addressed to him  , and orders must be obeyed  .
i think we do know the sweet roman hand  .
i think we know whose fancy handwriting that was  .
wilt thou go to bed  , malvolio  ?
do n't you think you should go to bed  , malvolio  ?
to bed  ?
to bed  !
ay  , sweetheart  , and i 'll come to thee  .
yes  , sweetheart  , i 'll come to you  .
how do you  , malvolio  ?
how are you feeling  , malvolio  ?
at your request  !
you 're asking me  !
yes  , nightingales answer daws  !
noble people do n't answer to peasants  !
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady  ?
why are you acting so brazen toward my lady  ?
be not afraid of greatness  .
do n't be afraid of greatness  .
't was well writ  .
that was well written  .
what meanest thou by that  , malvolio  ?

and wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs  .
cross - gartered  ?
crisscrossed  ?
am i made  ?

if not  , let me see thee a servant still  .
if you do n't want it  , just keep acting like a lowly servant  .

where 's my cousin toby  ?

have some of my servants take care of malvolio  .
i would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry  .
i 'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him  .
which way is he  , in the name of sanctity  ?
where is he  , for god 's sake  ?
if all the devils of hell be drawn in little  , and legion himself possessed him  , yet i 'll speak to him  .
i do n't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him  , i still want to speak to him  .
sir toby belch lo  , how hollow the fiend speaks within him  !

sir toby belch la you  , an you speak ill of the devil  , how he takes it at heart  !

my lady would never want to lose him  .

do n't you see you 're upsetting him  ?
let me alone with him  .
leave me alone with him  .
no way but gentleness  , gently  , gently  .
gentleness is the only way to go gently  , gently  .
the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used  .
the devil inside him is rough  , but we ca n't treat it roughly  .

sir toby belch no  , i 'm telling you  , he refuses to hear anything about religion  .

is it possible  ?
if this were played upon a stage now  , i could condemn it as an improbable fiction  .
if this were a play  , i 'd complain it was unrealistic  .
nay  , pursue him now  , lest the device take air and taint  .
no  , follow him now  , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything  .
why  , we shall make him mad indeed  .
wow  , we 're really going to drive him crazy  .
the house will be the quieter  .
the house will be so much quieter  .
more matter for a may morning  .

youth  , whatsoever thou art  , thou art but a scurvy fellow  .
young man  , whatever you are  , you 're a real scum bucket  .
wonder not  , nor admire not in thy mind  , why i do call thee so  , for i will show thee no reason for 't  .
do n't even ask why i call you that  , because i wo n't give you any explanation  .
a good note  , that keeps you from the blow of the law  .
that 's a good thing to put in it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law  .
thou comest to the lady olivia  , and in my sight she uses thee kindly  .
you come to see the lady olivia  , and she 's kind to you  .
but thou liest in thy throat  .
but you 're a complete liar  .
that is not the matter i challenge thee for  .
that 's not why i 'm challenging you to a duel  .
very brief  , and to exceeding good sense less  .
nice and short and full of good sense or should i say nonsense  ?
i will waylay thee going home  , where if it be thy chance to kill me
i 'll ambush you on your way home  , and if you 're lucky enough to kill me
good  .
good  .
thou killest me like a rogue and a villain  .
you 'll be killing me like a common criminal  , a mugger  .
still you keep o ' the windy side of the law  .
you still have n't said anything incriminating  .
good  .
good  .
if this letter move him not  , his legs can not  .
if this letter does n't make him fight  , i do n't know what will  .
i 'll give 't him  .
i 'll give it to him  .
you may have very fit occasion for 't  .
you might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now  .
he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart  .
he 's conducting some business with my lady  , and sooner or later he 'll leave  .
nay  , let me alone for swearing  .
do n't worry about me not swearing enough  .
here he comes with your niece  .
here comes the messenger with your niece  .
give them way till he take leave  , and presently after him  .
leave them alone until he sets off home  , and then follow him  .
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge  .
meanwhile  , i 'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge  .
with the same 'havior that your passion bears goes on my master 's grief  .
my lord acts just as crazy with love as you do  .
here  , wear this jewel for me  .
here  , take this piece of jewelry  .
't is my picture  .
there 's a picture of me inside  .
refuse it not  .
do n't refuse it  .
it hath no tongue to vex you  .
it wo n't annoy you like me  , because it does n't have a voice  .
and i beseech you come again tomorrow  .
and i beg you  , please come here again tomorrow  .
what shall you ask of me that i 'll deny  , that honor  , saved  , may upon asking give  ?
what could you possibly ask of me that i would n't give you  , as long as it did n't damage my honor and self - respect  ?
nothing but this  : your true love for my master  .
nothing  , except your true love for my lord  .
how with mine honor may i give him that which i have given to you  ?
how could i honorably give him what i 've already given you  ?
i will acquit you  .
i 'll give it back to you  .
well  , come again tomorrow  .
just come again tomorrow  .
fare thee well  .
good - bye  .
a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell  .
a devil like you could lead me to hell  .
gentleman  , god save thee  .
hello  , sir  .
and you  , sir  .
hello to you  .
you mistake  , sir  .
there must be some mistake  , sir  .
i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me  .
i 'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me  .
my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man  .
i ca n't remember anything i 've ever done to offend anyone  .
i pray you  , sir  , what is he  ?
but who is this person  , sir  ?
he is knight  , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration  , but he is a devil in private brawl  .
he 's a knight  .
souls and bodies hath he divorced three  , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre  .
he was made a knight because of his court connections  , but when he 's fighting a civilian he 's a real monster  .
hob  , nob  , is his word  .
he 's killed three people  , and he 's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die  .
give 't or take 't  .
fight to the death is his motto  .
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady  .
i 'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort  .
i am no fighter  .
i 'm not a fighter  .
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others  , to taste their valor  .
i 've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose  , just to see how brave they are  .
belike this is a man of that quirk  .
this man is probably like that  .
this is as uncivil as strange  .
this is as rude as it is strange  .
i beseech you  , do me this courteous office  , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is  .
please  , do me this one favor  : find out what i 've done to offend this knight  .
it is something of my negligence  , nothing of my purpose  .
it must be something i did accidentally  .
pray you  , sir  , do you know of this matter  ?
excuse me  , sir  , do you know anything about this  ?
i know the knight is incensed against you  , even to a mortal arbitrament  , but nothing of the circumstance more  .
i know the knight is furious with you  , so much that he 's willing to fight you to the death  , but i do n't know anything else about it  .
i beseech you  , what manner of man is he  ?
what kind of man is he  ?
nothing of that wonderful promise  , to read him by his form  , as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor  .
he 's not much to look at  , but he 's very brave in battle  .
he is  , indeed  , sir  , the most skillful  , bloody  , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria  .
he really is the most skillful  , bloodthirsty  , and dangerous opponent you can find in illyria  .
will you walk towards him  ?
do you want to go see him  ?
i will make your peace with him if i can  .
i 'll try to calm him down for you if i can  .
why  , man  , he 's a very devil  .
wow  , he 's a real devil  .
i have not seen such a firago  .
i 've never seen such a monster  .
i had a pass with him  , rapier  , scabbard  , and all  , and he gives me the stuck - in with such a mortal motion  , that it is inevitable  .
i had a round with him  , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you ca n't even duck out of the way  .
and on the answer  , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on  .
and when he strikes back at you  , he 'll hit you as sure as you 're standing there  .
they say he has been fencer to the sophy  .
they say he used to fence for the shah of persia  .
pox on 't  !
that 's it  !
i 'll not meddle with him  .
i wo n't mess with him  .
ay  , but he will not now be pacified  .
yes  , but now there 's no way to calm him down  .
fabian can scarce hold him yonder  .
fabian can hardly control him over there  .
plague on 't  , an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence  , i 'd have seen him damned ere i 'd have challenged him  .
darn it  , if i 'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman  , i never would have challenged him  .
let him let the matter slip  , and i 'll give him my horse  , gray capilet  .
i 'll give him my gray horse capilet if he forgets the whole thing  .
i 'll make the motion  .
i 'll give it a try  .
stand here  , make a good show on 't  .
stay right here and try to look good  .
this shall end without the perdition of souls  .
this may end without anyone getting killed  .
marry  , i 'll ride your horse as well as i ride you  .
i 'll ride your horse just like i ride you  .
pray god defend me  !
god help me  !
a little thing would make me tell them how much i lack of a man  .
if anything happens i 'm going to have to tell them exactly how unmanly i am  .
give ground  , if you see him furious  .
back off if he seems really furious  .
come  , sir andrew  , there 's no remedy  .
come on  , sir andrew  , there 's nothing you can do about it  .
the gentleman will  , for his honor 's sake  , have one bout with you  .
the gentleman insists on fighting a round with you  , for the sake of his honor  .
he can not by the duello avoid it  .
the rules of dueling say he has to  .
but he has promised me  , as he is a gentleman and a soldier  , he will not hurt you  .
but as a gentleman and a soldier he 's promised me he wo n't hurt you  .
come on  , to 't  .
come on  , get ready  .
pray god  , he keep his oath  !
i hope to god he keeps his promise  !
i do assure you  , 't is against my will  .
i swear to you  , i do n't want to be doing this  .
put up your sword  .
put your sword away  .
if this young gentleman have done offence  , i take the fault on me  .
if this young gentleman has offended you  , i 'll take the blame for it  .
if you offend him  , i for him defy you  .
if you 've offended him  , i 'll fight you  .
you  , sir  ?
you  , sir  ?
why  , what are you  ?
who are you  ?
nay  , if you be an undertaker  , i am for you  .
if you 're someone who gets into fights  , i 'll fight with you  .
o good sir toby  , hold  !
oh  , sir toby  , stop  !
here come the officers  .
the police are here  .
antonio i 'll be with you anon  .
antonio i 'll be back for you soon  .
marry  , will i  , sir  .
i certainly will  , sir  .
and for that i promised you  , i 'll be as good as my word  .
and as for what i promised to you  , i 'm as good as my word  .
he will bear you easily and reins well  .
you can ride him easily  , and he responds well when you pull the reins  .
this is the man  .
this is the man  .
do thy office  .
do your job  .
antonio  , i arrest thee at the suit of count orsino  .
antonio  , you 're under arrest on the orders of count orsino  .
you do mistake me  , sir  .
you must be mistaking me for someone else  , sir  .
no  , sir  , no jot  .
no  , sir  , not at all  .
i know your favor well  , though now you have no sea - cap on your head  .
i recognize your face perfectly  , even without a sailor 's cap on your head  .
take him away  .
take him away  .
he knows i know him well  .
he knows i recognize him  .
what will you do  , now my necessity makes me to ask you for my purse  ?
i 'm more upset about not being able to help you than i am about what 's going to happen to me  .
it grieves me much more for what i can not do for you than what befalls myself  .
you look so confused  .
you stand amazed  , but be of comfort  .
do n't worry about me  .
come  , sir  , away  .
come on  , sir  , let 's go  .
viola i must entreat of you some of that money  .
viola really  , i must ask you for some of that money  .
what money  , sir  ?
what money  , sir  ?
for the fair kindness you have showed me here  , and part being prompted by your present trouble  , out of my lean and low ability i 'll lend you something  .
i feel sorry for you in this situation  , and i want to thank you for the kindness you 've shown me here  , so i 'll lend you some of my money  , though i do n't have much  .
my having is not much  .
i 'll give you half of everything i have right now  .
i 'll make division of my present with you  .
take this  .
hold  , there 's half my coffer  .
it 's half of all my money  .
i know of none  , nor know i you by voice or any feature  .

sayest thou that house is dark  ?
you call this house dark  ?
as hell  , sir topas  .
dark as hell  , sir topas  .

i know you  .
how dost thou  , my good fellow  ?
how are you  , my friend  ?
truly  , sir  , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends  .

marry  , sir  , they praise me and make an ass of me  , now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass  .
well  , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot  , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that i am an idiot  .
so that by my foes  , sir i profit in the knowledge of myself  , and by my friends  , i am abused  .
my enemies help me understand myself better  , which is an advantage  , and my friends help me lie about myself  , which is a disadvantage  .
so that  , conclusions to be as kisses  , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives  , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes  .

why  , this is excellent  .
that 's excellent  .
by my troth  , sir  , no though it please you to be one of my friends  .

thou shalt not be the worse for me  : there 's gold  .
you wo n't be worse off because of me  : here 's some money  .
o  , you give me ill counsel  .
oh  , you 're a naughty one  , encouraging double - dealing  .
put your grace in your pocket  , sir  , for this once  , and let your flesh and blood obey it  .
ignore your virtue and nobility just this once  , sir  , go ahead  .
you can fool no more money out of me at this throw  .
you ca n't get any more money out of me right now  .
if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her  , and bring her along with you  , it may awake my bounty further  .
if you tell your lady i 'm here to speak with her  , and bring her out with you when you come back  , you might make me more generous  .
marry  , sir  , lullaby to your bounty till i come again  .
well then  , sing a lullaby to your generosity  : it 'll nap until i come back  .
i go  , sir  , but i would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness  .
but do n't think i 'm doing this because i 'm greedy  .
but  , as you say  , sir  , let your bounty take a nap  , i will awake it anon  .
i 'll be back soon to wake up your generosity  .

my lord wants to speak  .
my duty hushes me  .
it 's my duty to be quiet  .
if it be aught to the old tune  , my lord  , it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear as howling after music  .
if what you have to say is anything like what you used to say  , it 'll be as repulsive to my ears as wild screams after beautiful music  .
still so cruel  ?
are you still so cruel  ?
still so constant  , lord  .
i am still so faithful  , my lord  .
even what it please my lord that shall become him  .

alas  , it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety  .
you 're afraid  , so you hide your identity  .
fear not  , cesario  .
but do n't be afraid  , cesario  .
take thy fortunes up  .
accept the good luck that 's come your way  .
be that thou know'st thou art  , and then thou art as great as that thou fear'st  .

if you want things done in the right way  , you 'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice  .

i 'll be revenged on the whole pack of you  .
i 'll get my revenge on every last one of you  .
he hath been most notoriously abused  .
he really was tricked horribly  .
pursue him and entreat him to a peace  .
go after him and try to calm him down a little  .
he hath not told us of the captain yet  .
he still has n't told us about the captain  .
when that is known and golden time convents  , a solemn combination shall be made of our dear souls  .
when that 's been taken care of and the time is right  , we 'll all get married  .
meantime  , sweet sister  , we will not part from hence  .
until then  , we 'll stay here  , my dear sister - in - law  .
cesario  , come  , for so you shall be  , while you are a man  .
cesario  , come here  .
but when in other habits you are seen  , orsino 's mistress and his fancy 's queen  .
i 'll keep calling you cesario while you 're still a man  , but when we see you in women 's clothes you 'll be the queen of my dreams  , orsino 's true love  .
