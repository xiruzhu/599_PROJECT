if it be love indeed , tell me how much .
if what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
there 's beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
it would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
i 'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
i want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
news , my good lord , from rome .
i have news from rome , my good lord .
how , my love ?
what , my love ?

is caesar with antonius prized so slight ?
does antony have so little respect for caesar ?
sir , sometimes when he is not antony he comes too short of that great property which still should go with antony .
sir , sometimes he 's like a different person , a person who ca n't measure up to the former antony .

your beauty will be even greater than it is now .
he means in flesh .
he means i 'll get fat .
no , you shall paint when you are old .
no , he means you 'll use makeup when you 're old .
wrinkles forbid !
may my wrinkles forbid that !
hush !
quiet !
you shall be more beloving than beloved .
you will love more than you are loved .
i had rather heat my liver with drinking .
than from love .
nay , hear him .
just listen to him .
you shall outlive the lady whom you serve .
you will outlive the queen .
you have seen and proved a fairer former fortune than that which is to approach .
you have already had better fortune than the future will bring .
if every of your wishes had a womb , and fertile every wish , a million .
if every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
you seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
we 'll know all our fortunes .
we 'll all want our fortune told .
mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be drunk to bed .
my fortune like that of many of us tonight is to go drunk to bed .

like the predicts famine .
your fortunes are alike .

fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
your wife , fulvia , mustered her army first .
against my brother lucius ?
against my brother lucius ?
well , what worst ?
well , give me the worst news .
the nature of bad news infects the teller .
the bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
`` antony , '' thou wouldst say .
`` while antony ... '' is what you want to say .
o my lord !
oh , my lord !
fare thee well awhile .
good-bye for a while .
at your noble pleasure .
i 'll be at your service .
the man from sicyon
the man from sicyon
is there such an one ?
is he here ?
he stays upon your will .
he 's waiting outside .
let him appear .
have him come in .
these strong egyptian fetters i must break , or lose myself in dotage .
i must break cleopatra 's powerful hold over me or else i 'll lose myself in foolish infatuation .
what are you ?
what 's your message ?
fulvia thy wife is dead .
your wife , fulvia , is dead .
where died she ?
where did she die ?
forbear me .
leave me .
what 's your pleasure , sir ?
what would you like , sir ?
i must with haste from hence .
i have to leave right away .
i must be gone .
i must be gone .
she is cunning past man 's thought .
she 's more cunning than anyone can imagine .
would i had never seen her !
i wish i 'd never seen her !
o sir , you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel .
then you 'd have missed an amazing piece of work , sir , and your trip would have been poorer for the loss .
fulvia is dead .
fulvia is dead .
sir ?
pardon me ?
fulvia is dead .
fulvia is dead .
fulvia ?
fulvia ?
dead .
dead .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence .
i must go and continue the business fulvia started .
and the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of cleopatra 's , which wholly depends on your abode .
the business you began here needs you as well especially the business with cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
i shall do 't .
i will .
where is he ?
where is he ?
i did not see him since .
i have n't seen him recently .
madam , methinks , if you did love him dearly , you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him .
madam , i think if you love him so much , you are n't using the best way to get him to reciprocate .
what should i do i do not ?
what should i do that i 'm not doing ?
but here comes antony .
but here comes antony .
i am sick and sullen .
i am sick and sullen .
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
i 'm sorry to have to say this
now , my dearest queen
now , my dearest queen
pray you , stand farther from me .
please , stand farther away from me .
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
the gods best know
the gods know
cleopatra
cleopatra
most sweet queen
most sweet queen
how now , lady ?
what do you mean , lady ?
she 's dead , my queen .
she 's dead , my queen .
you can do better yet , but this is meetly .
i know you can do better than that , but it 'll do for now .
now , by my sword
i swear by my sword
i 'll leave you , lady .
i 'll leave you , lady .
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject , i should take you for idleness itself .
if you were n't the queen of immaturity , i 'd think you were immaturity itself .
here 's more news .
here 's more news .
't is pity of him .
it 's too bad .
tomorrow , caesar , i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time .
tomorrow , caesar , i 'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces i can raise for this war .
charmian !
charmian !
madam ?
madam ?
why , madam ?
why , madam ?
that i might sleep out this great gap of time my antony is away .
so i can sleep away the time while my antony is gone .
you think of him too much .
you think about him too much .
oh , 't is treason !
that 's treason !
madam , i trust , not so .
i hope not , madam .
what 's your highness ' pleasure ?
what can i do for your highness ?
yes , gracious madam .
yes , dear madam .
indeed ?
indeed ?
sovereign of egypt , hail !
queen of egypt , greetings !
last thing he did , dear queen , he kissed the last of many doubled kisses this orient pearl .
the last thing he did before sending me off , dear queen , was to kiss the last of many such kisses this indian pearl for you .
his speech sticks in my heart .
his speech is stored in my heart .
mine ear must pluck it thence .
my ear must pull it out .
what was he , sad or merry ?
was he sad or happy ?
like to the time o ' th ' year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
he was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
oh , that brave caesar !
oh , that splendid caesar !
the valiant caesar !
the courageous caesar !
by isis , i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men .
by isis , i 'll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare caesar with antony , my best man among men .
by your most gracious pardon , i sing but after you .
pardon me , but i 'm just repeating what you yourself have said .
if the great gods be just , they shall assist the deeds of justest men .
if the great gods are just , they will help the most honest men .
know , worthy pompey , that what they do delay , they not deny .
you should know , noble pompey , that although the gods may delay action , that does n't mean they will necessarily refuse their help .
whiles we are suitors to their throne , decays the thing we sue for .
but while we pray and wait for that help , the cause we petition for may be lost .
from silvius , sir .
from silvius , sir .
how now , varrius ?
what 's the news , varrius ?
good enobarbus , 't is a worthy deed , and shall become you well , to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech .
good enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
't is not a time for private stomaching .
this is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
every time serves for the matter that is then born in 't .
it 's always appropriate to deal with matters as they arise .
but small to greater matters must give way .
but major issues must come before minor ones .
not if the small come first .
not if the minor ones come up first .
and yonder , caesar .
and there comes caesar .
welcome to rome .
welcome to rome .
thank you .
thank you .
sit .
have a seat .
sit , sir .
after you .
nay , then .
no , after you .
i learn , you take things ill which are not so , or being , concern you not .
i hear you 've interpreted some of my actions as being improper , when they were n't improper at all or if they were , their impropriety did n't concern you .
i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you chiefly i ' th ' world ; more laughed at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concerned me .
i should be ridiculed if i were offended so easily and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when i had no reason to speak of you at all .
my being in egypt , caesar , what was 't to you ?
caesar , what did my stay in egypt have to do with you ?
how intend you , `` practiced '' ?
how do you mean , `` conspired '' ?
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patched up your excuses .
you defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you 're just making up feeble excuses .
soft , caesar .
easy , caesar .
't is noble spoken .
spoken like a gentleman .
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye , to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you .
if it 's okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
worthily spoken , maecenas .
well put , maecenas .
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot .
oh , i 'd forgotten that no one 's supposed to speak the truth .
give me leave , caesar .
may i speak , caesar .
speak , agrippa .
what is it , agrippa ?
will caesar speak ?
what do you say , caesar ?
not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already .
i 'd rather hear your reaction to this first .
the power of caesar , and his power unto octavia .
he has both my power and my influence over octavia .
there 's my hand .
here 's my hand .
happily , amen !
i 'm happy to say `` amen '' to that !
where lies he ?
where is he now ?
about the mount misena .
near .
what is his strength by land ?
how large is his land army ?
let us , lepidus , not lack your company .
come with us , lepidus .
noble antony , not sickness should detain me .
noble antony , even illness could n't keep me away .
welcome from egypt , sir .
welcome back from egypt , sir .
good enobarbus !
good enobarbus !
she 's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
she 's a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
when she first met mark antony , she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus .
from the first time antony saw her , sailing on her barge on the , he was hers .
there she appeared indeed , or my reporter devised well for her .
she made quite an appearance there , or else my informant invented a very flattering description of her .
oh , rare for antony !
how excellent for antony !
rare egyptian !
extraordinary egyptian !
now antony must leave her utterly .
now antony has to leave her completely .
if beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle the heart of antony , octavia is a blessd lottery to him .
if beauty , wisdom , and modesty can settle antony 's restless heart , octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him .
humbly , sir , i thank you .
i humbly thank you .
the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom .
there will be times when my duties and responsibilities take me away from you .
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you .
and i will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
good night .
good night .
now , sirrah , you do wish yourself in egypt ?
now , , i hear you wish you were back in egypt .
would i had never come from thence , nor you thither .
i wish i had never left egypt and that you had never come to egypt .
if you can , your reason ?
tell me why , if you can .
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , caesar 's or mine ?
tell me who shall have the better luck , caesar or me ?
speak this no more .
do n't speak of this again .
sir , mark antony will e'en but kiss octavia , and we 'll follow .
sir , we 'll follow as soon as mark antony kisses octavia good-bye .
till i shall see you in your soldiers ' dress , which will become you both , farewell .
good-bye then , until the time i see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
sir , good success .
good luck , sir .
farewell .
farewell .

i 'm going to make you a rich man .
but yet , madam

for the best turn i ' th ' bed .
for the favor of sleeping in her bed .
i am pale , charmian .
i 'm sick , charmian .
madam , he 's married to octavia .
he 's married to octavia , madam .
the most infectious pestilence upon thee !
may you die of the worst disease !
good madam , patience .
good madam , be patient .
what say you ?
what did you say to me ?
thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , smarting in ling'ring pickle !
i 'll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
he 's married , madam .
he 's married , madam .
rogue , thou hast lived too long .
rogue , you 've lived too long !
he is afeard to come .
he 's afraid to come in .
i have done my duty .
i 've only done my duty .
he 's married , madam .
he 's married , madam .
should i lie , madam ?
do you want me to lie , madam ?
i crave your highness ' pardon .
i beg your highness ' pardon .
he is married ?
is he really married ?
good your highness , patience .
be patient , your highness .
in praising antony , i have dispraised caesar .
when i have praised antony , i 've disparaged caesar .
many times , madam .
many times , madam .
take your time .
take your time .
be pleased to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you .
to get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
there 's the point .
that 's the point .
which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced .
do n't let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
and what may follow , to try a larger fortune .
and consider the possible consequences of fighting against us , in the hopes of gaining a greater fortune .
that 's our offer .
that 's our offer .
i have heard it , pompey , and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you .
i heard what you did for her , pompey , and want to give you the many thanks i owe you .
let me have your hand .
let me shake your hand .
i did not think , sir , to have met you here .
i did n't think i would see you here .
since i saw you last there 's a change upon you .
you 've changed since the last time i saw you .
well , i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face , but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal .
well , i can not tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but i will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
well met here .
it 's good we had this meeting .
that 's the next to do .
that 's the next thing on the agenda .
that will i , pompey .
i 'll give the first one , pompey .
you have heard much .
you 've heard a lot .
i have fair meanings , sir .
i mean well , sir .
and fair words to them .
i 'm sure you do .
what , i pray you ?
what did he carry , please ?
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress .
a certain queen to caesar , .
well , and well am like to do , for i perceive , four feasts are toward .
i 'm well , and probably will be for a while , as i hear that four feasts are being prepared .
sir , i never loved you much , but i ha ' praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did .
sir , i would n't say i was your friend , but i 've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than i gave .
show 's the way , sir .
show us the way , sir .
come .
come with me .
at sea , i think .
i think it was at sea .
we have , sir .
that it was , sir .
you have done well by water .
you 've done well at sea .
and you by land .
and you 've done well on land .
i will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what i have done by land .
i 'll flatter anyone who flatters me though what i 've accomplished on land can not be denied .
nor what i have done by water .
neither can my accomplishments at sea .
yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
and you by land .
as you were on land .
if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
if our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we 're embracing .
all men 's faces are true , whatsome'er their hands are .
men 's faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face .
but no beautiful woman has an honest face .
we came hither to fight with you .
we came here to fight against you .
if he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
if that 's true , he wo n't get it back by crying .
caesar 's sister is called octavia .
caesar 's sister is named octavia .
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius .
but she is now mark antony 's wife .
pray ye , sir ?
excuse me , sir ?
't is true .
it 's true .
then is caesar and he forever knit together .
then caesar and he will always be united .
if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so .
if i were to make a prediction regarding this union , i would n't say that .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
i think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
who would not have his wife so ?
does n't everyone want a wife like that ?
come , let 's away .
let 's go .
lepidus is high-colored .
lepidus is red in the face .
they have made him drink alms-drink .
they made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion .
which goes on to impede his judgment .
to be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move in 't , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks .
to be so unimportant in the company of important men is like having a face without any eyes .
you 've strange serpents there ?
do you have unusual snakes there ?
ay , lepidus .
yes , lepidus .
they are so .
yes , lepidus .
i am not so well as i should be , but i 'll ne'er out .
i do n't feel so well , but i wo n't stop .
pompey , a word .
pompey , could i have a word with you ?
forsake thy seat , i do beseech thee , captain , and hear me speak a word .
please , captain , leave the feast and let me speak with you privately .
what manner o ' thing is your crocodile ?
what does a crocodile look like ?
what color is it of ?
what color is it ?
of it own color too .
its own color .
't is a strange serpent .
it 's a strange snake .
will this description satisfy him ?
will that description satisfy him ?
with the health that pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure .
that last toast pompey gave him will take care of him , unless he 's a raging glutton .
if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , rise from thy stool .
if any service i 've done you deserves a favor , get up from your stool and speak with me .
i think th ' art mad .
i think you 're crazy !
the matter ?
what is it ?
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
i 've always had great respect for your destiny .
these quicksands , lepidus , keep off them , for you sink .
stay away from the quicksand of drink , lepidus : you 're sinking .
wilt thou be lord of all the world ?
would you like to be king of the entire world ?
what sayst thou ?
what are you saying ?
how should that be ?
how could that happen ?
hast thou drunk well ?
are you drunk ?
show me which way .
tell me how .
this health to lepidus !
this toast is for lepidus !
here 's to thee , menas !
here 's to you , menas .
enobarbus , welcome .
i accept with thanks , enobarbus .
fill till the cup be hid .
fill the cups until they run over .
there 's a strong fellow , menas .
there goes a strong fellow , menas .
why ?
why do you say that ?
come .
all right , then .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast .
this has n't reached the level of an egyptian feast yet .
be a child o ' th ' time .
live in the moment .
let 's ha 't , good soldier .
let 's have one , good soldier .
come , let 's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe .
come , let 's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
i 'll try you on the shore .
we 'll have a rematch at your feast on shore .
take heed you fall not .
be careful not to fall in .
menas , i 'll not on shore .
menas , i 'm not going back on shore .
where is he now ?
where 's antony now ?
what , are the brothers parted ?
did the brothers-in-law leave ?
nay , but how dearly he adores mark antony !
yes , but how he adores mark antony !
indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
he certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
both he loves .
he loves them both .
they are his shards , and he .
they are his dung , and he their beetle .
good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
no further , sir .
you ca n't go any further with us , sir .
make me not offended in your distrust .
do n't insult me with your distrust .
i have said .
i mean what i say .
my noble brother !
my noble brother !
sir , look well to my husband 's house , and
take care of my former husband 's property , and
what , octavia ?
what is it , octavia ?
i 'll tell you in your ear .
i 'll tell you privately .
will caesar weep ?
do you think caesar will cry ?
he has a cloud in 's face .
he does look like it .
thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
and thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
let all the number of the stars give light to thy fair way .
may every star light your path .
farewell , farewell .
farewell , farewell .
farewell .
farewell .
where is the fellow ?
where is that messenger ?
half afeard to come .
he 's afraid to come in .
good majesty , herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased .
gracious queen , even herod of judea would n't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
most gracious majesty !
most formidable queen !
didst thou behold octavia ?
did you see octavia ?
ay , dread queen .
yes , revered queen .
where ?
where ?
is she as tall as me ?
is she as tall as i am ?
she is not , madam .
she is not , madam .
is this certain ?
is this true ?
or i have no observance .
if not , then i have no powers of observation .
three in egypt can not make better note .
there are n't three people in all of egypt who could do better .
excellent .
very wise .
guess at her years , i prithee .
how old do you think she is ?
madam , she was a widow
she was a widow previously , madam .
and i do think she 's thirty .
and i think she 's at least thirty .
round , even to faultiness .
round enough to be unattractive .
brown , madam , and her forehead as low as she would wish it .
brown , madam , and she would n't want her forehead to be any lower .
a proper man .
he 's an admirable man .
nothing , madam .
not a bit , madam .
i warrant you , madam .
i assure you it is , madam .
how now , friend eros !
how goes it , friend eros ?
there 's strange news come , sir .
some startling news has just arrived , sir .
what , man ?
what news , man ?
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey .
caesar and lepidus declared war against pompey .
our great navy 's rigged .
antony 's grand navy is prepared .
come , sir .
come with me , sir .
this in the public eye ?
he did this in public ?
let rome be thus informed .
let 's send this news to rome .
the people knows it , and have now received his accusations .
the people have heard it already , and they 've been told of his accusations .
who does he accuse ?
who does he accuse ?
sir , this should be answered .
sir , these accusations should be answered .
he 'll never yield to that .
he 'll never agree to that .
nor must not then be yielded to in this .
then we wo n't agree to his demands .
that ever i should call thee castaway !
oh , to think you 've been rejected !
you have not called me so , nor have you cause .
you 've never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
which soon he granted , being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him .
which he quickly allowed , given that you 're an obstacle to his lust .
do not say so , my lord .
do n't say that , my lord .
my lord , in athens .
he 's in athens , my lord .
welcome , lady .
welcome , lady .
is it so , sir ?
is that true , sir ?
but why , why , why ?
but why , why , why ?
what is 't you say ?
what do you mean ?
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent .
no one admires speed more than the lazy .
why will my lord do so ?
why do you want to do that , my lord ?
for that he dares us to 't .
because he 's daring us to do it .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight .
so you 've dared him to single combat .
i 'll fight at sea .
i 'll fight at sea .

i 'm helping mess up one of god 's creations your poor , unworthy brother by having him do nothing .

well , i 'll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
what shall be our sport , then ?
well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
let 's go find that hussy , fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
i would we could do so , for her benefits are mightily misplaced , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women .
i wish we could do that , because fortune gives all of her gifts to the wrong people , and she especially gets things wrong where women are concerned .
't is true , for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest , and those that she makes honest she makes very ill- favoredly .
it 's true : the women she makes beautiful she also makes slutty , and the women she makes pure and virginal she also makes ugly .
indeed , there is fortune too hard for nature , when fortune makes nature 's natural the cutter-off of nature 's wit .
yes , and now fortune is playing a nasty trick on nature : she 's breaking up a show of wit between two naturally witty women with the arrival of a natural fool .
mistress , you must come away to your father .
mistress , you have to go see your father .

where learned you that oath , fool ?
where 'd you learn a phrase like , `` by my honor , '' fool ?
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
and how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
prithee , who is 't that thou mean'st ?
tell me , who is this knight ?
one that old frederick , your father , loves .
a man old frederick , your father , loves .
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .

do you think so ?
do you think so ?
not true in love ?
you think his feelings are n't true ?

who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
marry , that should you if i were your mistress , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
indeed , you would be out if i were your mistress if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
what , of my suit ?
would i be out of my ?
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her .
i like to pretend you are , because then it 's almost like actually talking to her .

by my life , she will do as i do .

a man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say `` wit , whither wilt ? ''
a man with a wife like that might ask , `` hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? ''

that 's the deal .
silvius you say that you 'll have phoebe if she will ?

well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
i like him very well .
i like him very well .
by my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
really , he 's very witty , and full of wise sayings .
according to the fool 's bolt , sir , and such dulcet diseases .
his wittiness , a sweet disease , is here one minute and gone the next , sir , as with most fools .
and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
and how many times did you say his beard was n't cut well ?
i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial , nor he durst not give me the lie direct , and so we measured swords and parted .
i did n't dare take it past `` the circumstantial lie , '' and he did n't dare go to the `` , '' so we compared the lengths of our swords and then ended the fight .
can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie ?
can you name the steps of that argument again ?
he uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
he uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .

many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
sir , i commend you to your own content .
sir , i leave you to your own contentment .
why should their liberty than ours be more ?
why should men be more free than women ?
because their business still lies out o ' door .
because their business lies outside the home .
look when i serve him so , he takes it ill .
listen , when i behave this way toward him , he hates it .
o , know he is the bridle of your will .
oh , you should know that he 's the to your will .
there 's none but asses will be bridled so .
only a mule would agree to that .
this servitude makes you to keep unwed .
it 's this servantlike mentality that 's keeping you unmarried .
not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
no , that 's not it it 's because of what happens in the marriage bed .

but if you were married , you 'd wield some influence .

all i know is that i 'm being beaten .
shall i tell you why ?
should i tell you why ?
marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
because you gave me something for nothing .
in good time , sir , what 's that ?
what would that be ?
basting .
a basting .
well , sir , then 'twill be dry .
well , then it will be dry .
if it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .
if it is , i suggest you do n't eat it .
your reason ?
why not ?
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric .
before you got so angry , i never would have thought that .
by what rule , sir ?
why not ?
marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself .
i 'll tell you : it 's because of a law as plain as father time 's bald head .
let 's hear it .
let 's hear it .
there 's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
there may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
may he not do it by fine and recovery ?
ca n't he get it by ?
yes , to pay a fine for a periwig , and recover the lost hair of another man .
yes , he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another man 's lost hair .
why , but there 's many a man hath more hair than wit .
but a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair .
and not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald .
why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
so then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
for what reason ?
why ?
nay , not sound , i pray you .
not good ones , please .
sure ones , then .
then sure ones .
nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
no , not sure ones when we 're talking about something unsure .
certain ones , then .
then certain ones .
name them .
name them .
the one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
one , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it does n't land in their dinner .
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
you were supposed to be proving that there is n't time for everything .
but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover .
you did n't come up with a very good proof .
thus i mend it : time himself is bald and therefore , to the world 's end , will have bald followers .
then i 'll change it to this : father time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .

dromio ?

i think you 're an ass .
i hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
your delicacies are n't worth as much to me as your welcome is .
o signior balthasar , either at flesh or fish a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish .
signior balthasar , all the welcome in the world ca n't compare to a good meal , whatever kind of food it might be .
good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
good food 's not a big deal everyone can afford that .
and welcome more common , for that 's nothing but words .
and everyone can say `` welcome , '' which is just a word .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
a little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .

it looks like you 've offended it .
see , it stalks away .
look , it 's going away .
before my god , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .
i swear to god , if i had n't seen this with my own eyes i 'd never believe it .
is it not like the king ?
does n't it look like the king ?
in what particular thought to work i know not , but in the gross and scope of mine opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state .
i do n't know exactly how to explain this , but i have a general feeling this means bad news for our country .
if thou hast any sound or use of voice , speak to me .
if you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
stop it , marcellus .
keep it from leaving , marcellus .
shall i strike at it with my partisan ?
should i strike it with my spear ?
do , if it will not stand .
yes , if it does n't stand still .
't is here .
it 's over here .
't is here .
there it is .
it was about to speak when the cock crew .
it was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
now for ourself and for this time of meeting
now , here 's what needs to be done .
in that and all things will we show our duty .
we 'll do our duty to you in that and everything else .
a little more than kin and less than kind .
too many family ties there for me .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
why are you still so gloomy , with a cloud hanging over you ?
ay , madam , it is common .
yes , mother , it happens all the time .
if it be , why seems it so particular with thee ?
so why does it seem so particular to you ?
i shall in all my best obey you , madam .
i 'll obey you as well as i can , ma'am .
hail to your lordship .
hello , sir .
my good lord .
hello , sir .
a truant disposition , good my lord .
i felt like skipping school , sir .
my lord , i came to see your father 's funeral .
sir , we came to see your father 's funeral .
indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
well , sir , it 's true it came soon after .
where , my lord ?
where , sir ?
in my mind 's eye , horatio .
in my imagination , horatio .
my lord , i think i saw him yesternight .
sir , i think i saw him last night .
saw who ?
saw who ?
for god 's love , let me hear .
for god 's sake , let me hear it .
but where was this ?
but where did this happen ?
my lord , upon the platform where we watch .
on the platform where we stand guard , sir .
did you not speak to it ?
did n't you talk to it ?
't is very strange .
that 's very strange .
we do , my lord .
yes , sir .
armed , say you ?
it was armed , you say ?
armed , my lord .
armed , sir .
from top to toe ?
from head to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
yes , from top to bottom , sir .
then saw you not his face ?
so you could n't see his face , then ?
what , looked he frowningly ?
was he frowning ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger .
he looked more sad than angry .
pale or red ?
was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
nay , very pale .
very pale , sir .
and fixed his eyes upon you ?
did he stare at you ?
most constantly .
the whole time .
i would i had been there .
i wish i 'd been there .
it would have much amazed you .
you would have been very shocked .
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
about as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
longer , longer .
no , longer than that .
not when i saw 't .
not the time i saw it .
his beard was grizzled , no ?
his beard was gray , right ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a sable silvered .
it was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
i warrant it will .
i bet it will .
our duty to your honor .
we 'll do our duty to you , sir .
do you doubt that ?
do you doubt i 'll write ?
no more but so ?
no more than a minute ?
o , fear me not .
do n't worry , i wo n't .
most humbly do i take my leave , my lord .
i humbly say good-bye to you , father .
't is in my memory locked , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
it 's locked away in my memory , and you 've got the key .
farewell .
good-bye .
what is 't , ophelia , he hath said to you ?
what did he tell you , ophelia ?
so please you , something touching the lord hamlet .
something about hamlet .
he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .
he 's offered me a lot of affection lately .
i do not know , my lord , what i should think .
i do n't know what to believe , father .
my lord , he hath importuned me with love in honorable fashion .
father , he 's always talked about love in an honorable fashion
and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of heaven .
and he 's made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
i shall obey , my lord .
i 'll do as you say , father .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
yes , it 's definitely nippy .
what hour now ?
what time is it ?
i think it lacks of twelve .
a little before twelve , i think .
no , it is struck .
no , it 's just after twelve ; i heard the clock strike .
what does this mean , my lord ?
what does that mean , sir ?
is it a custom ?
is that a tradition ?
look , my lord , it comes !
look , sir here it comes !
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone .
it wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
no , by no means .
definitely not .
do not , my lord .
do n't do it , sir .
you shall not go , my lord .
you 're not going , sir .
hold off your hands .
let go of me .
he waxes desperate with imagination .
his imagination is making him crazy .
something is rotten in the state of denmark .
it means that something is rotten in the state of denmark .
heaven will direct it .
if that 's true , we should let god take care of it .
nay , let 's follow him .
no , let 's follow him .
mark me .
listen to me .
i will .
i will .
my hour is almost come when i to sulfurous and tormenting flames must render up myself .
the hour has almost come when i have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
alas , poor ghost !
ah , poor ghost !
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear .
you must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
what ?
what ?
o god !
oh god !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
murder ?
murder ?
haste me to know 't , that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may sweep to my revenge .
hurry and tell me about it , so i can take revenge right away , faster than a person falls in love .
my lord , my lord !
sir , sir !
lord hamlet
lord hamlet .
heaven secure him !
please let him be all right !
so be it .
i 'm all right .
illo , ho , ho , my lord !
oh-ho-ho , sir !
how is 't , my noble lord ?
so how did it go , sir ?
what news , my lord ?
what happened , sir ?
oh , wonderful !
it was incredible !
good my lord , tell it .
oh , please , tell us , sir .
not i , my lord , by heaven .
i swear i wo n't , sir .
nor i , my lord .
i wo n't either , sir .
ay , by heaven , my lord .
yes , i swear .
there 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he 's an arrant knave .
any villain in denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this .
you do n't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
you 're talking in such a crazy way , sir .
never make known what you have seen tonight .
do n't ever tell anyone what you 've seen tonight .
my lord , we will not .
we wo n't , sir .
nay , but swear 't .
no , you have to swear it .
in faith , my lord , not i .
i swear to god i wo n't .
nor i , my lord , in faith .
me too , i wo n't , i swear to god .
upon my sword .
swear by my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
but we already swore , sir .
indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
yes , but swear by my sword this time .
swear !
swear !
propose the oath , my lord .
tell us what to swear , sir .
swear .
swear .
swear by his sword .
swear by his sword .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
my god , this is unbelievably strange .
swear !
swear .
give him this money and these notes , reynaldo .
give him this money and these letters , reynaldo .
i will , my lord .
i will , sir .
you shall do marvelous wisely , good reynaldo , before you visit him , to make inquire of his behavior .
it would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
my lord , i did intend it .
that 's what i thought too , sir .
ay , very well , my lord .
yes , very well , sir .
as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty .
sound like your average young guy , the kind of trouble they get into .
as gaming , my lord ?
like gambling , sir ?
ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarreling , drabbing you may go so far .
that 's right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes that kind of thing .
my lord , that would dishonor him !
but that would ruin his reputation !
but , my good lord
but , sir
wherefore should you do this ?
why should you do this , you want to know ?
very good , my lord .
yes , sir .
my lord , i have .
yes , i do , sir .
good my lord .
thank you , sir .
i shall , my lord .
i will , sir .
and let him ply his music .
and i hope he 's studying his music like he 's supposed to .
well , my lord .
got it , sir .
farewell .
good-bye .
o my lord , my lord , i have been so affrighted !
oh , father , father , i 've just had such a scare !
with what , i ' th ' name of god ?
from what , in god 's name ?
mad for thy love ?
is he crazy with love for you ?
what said he ?
what did he say ?
both your majesties might , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty .
both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
thanks , rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern .
thanks , rosencrantz and worthy guildenstern .
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
i hope to god we can make him happy and do him some good !
ay , amen !
amen to that !
th ' ambassadors from norway , my good lord , are joyfully returned .
the ambassadors are back from norway , sir .
thou still hast been the father of good news .
once again you bring good news .
and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet 's lunacy .
and i believe unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be that i 've found out why hamlet 's gone crazy .
thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
then be so kind as to show them in .
he tells me , my dear gertrude , he hath found the head and source of all your son 's distemper .
gertrude , he says he 's found out the reason for your son 's insanity .
i doubt it is no other but the main : his father 's death and our o'erhasty marriage .
i doubt it 's anything but the obvious reason : his father 's dying and our quick marriage .
more matter , with less art .
please , stick to the point .
came this from hamlet to her ?
hamlet wrote this letter to ophelia ?
but how hath she received his love ?
and how did she react to all this ?
what do you think of me ?
sir , what is your opinion of me ?
as of a man faithful and honorable .
i know you are loyal and honorable .
gertrude do you think 't is this ?
gertrude do you think that 's why hamlet 's crazy ?
it may be , very like .
it may be , it certainly may be .
hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said , `` 't is so , '' when it proved otherwise ?
has there ever been a time i 'd really like to know when i 've definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
not that i know .
not that i know of .
how may we try it further ?
what can we do to find out if it 's true ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .
well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
so he does indeed .
yes , he does .
we will try it .
we 'll try what you suggest .
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
look how sadly he 's coming in , reading his book .
how does my good lord hamlet ?
how are you , hamlet ?
well , god-'a'-mercy .
fine , thank you .
do you know me , my lord ?
do you know who i am ?
not i , my lord .
no , not me , sir .
then i would you were so honest a man .
in that case i wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
honest , my lord ?
good , sir ?
that 's very true , my lord .
that 's definitely true , my lord .
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter ?
since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse by the way , do you have a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
i do indeed , my lord .
words , words , words .
a lot of words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
and what is the subject ?
between who ?
between whom ?
i mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
i mean , what do the words say ?
into my grave .
into my grave .
you can not , sir , take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life , except my life , except my life .
you ca n't take anything from me that i care less about except my life , except my life , except my life .
fare you well , my lord .
good-bye , my lord .
these tedious old fools !
these boring old fools !
god save you , sir !
thank you , sir .
my honored lord !
my lord !
my most dear lord !
my dear sir !
as the indifferent children of the earth .
oh , as well as anybody .
nor the soles of her shoes ?
but you 're not down and out , either , are you ?
neither , my lord .
no , we 're just somewhere in the middle , my lord .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
so you 're around lady luck 's waist ?
faith , her privates we .
yes , we 're the privates in her army .
prison , my lord ?
prison , my lord ?
denmark 's a prison .
denmark 's a prison .
then is the world one .
then i guess the whole world is one .
a goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , denmark being one o ' th ' worst .
yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , denmark being one of the worst .
we think not so , my lord .
we do n't think so , my lord .
which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
but a dream itself is just a shadow .
we 'll wait upon you .
we 're at your service , whatever you say .
what should we say , my lord ?
what should we say , my lord ?
to what end , my lord ?
why would they do that , my lord ?
guildenstern what say you ?
guildenstern what do you think ?
my lord , we were sent for .
my lord , we were sent for .
my lord , there was no such stuff in my thoughts .
my lord , i was n't thinking anything like that .
why did you laugh then , when i said `` man delights not me '' ?
so why did you laugh when i said that men do n't interest me ?
even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
the tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
but things have changed there , and it 's easier for them on the road now .
no , indeed are they not .
no , not like before .
is 't possible ?
are you kidding ?
oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
oh , there 's been a lot of quarreling .
do the boys carry it away ?
and the boys are winning so far ?
there are the players .
the actors are here .
in what , my dear lord ?
in what sense , my lord ?
well be with you , gentlemen .
gentlemen , i hope you are well .
happily he 's the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
my lord , i have news for you .
the actors are come hither , my lord .
the actors have arrived , my lord .
buzz , buzz .
yawn , snore .
upon my honor
i swear
then came each actor on his ass
each actor arrived on his ass .
o jephthah , judge of israel , what a treasure hadst thou !
oh , , judge of ancient israel , what a treasure you had !
what a treasure had he , my lord ?
what treasure did he have , my lord ?
why , , .
well , , .
still on my daughter .
still talking about my daughter , i see .
am i not i ' th ' right , old jephthah ?
are n't i right , jephthah , old man ?
if you call me jephthah , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
if you 're calling me jephthah , my lord , i do have a daughter i love more than anything , yes .
what follows , then , my lord ?
what is logical , then , my lord ?
why ,
why ,
and then , you know , the first row of the pious chanson will show you more , for look where my abridgement comes .
, and then , you know , if you want to know more , you can refer to the popular song , because now i have to stop .
what speech , my good lord ?
which speech , my lord ?
'fore god , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good discretion .
my god , that was well done , my lord , with the right accent and a good ear .
this is too long .
this speech is going on too long .
`` the mobld queen '' ?
`` the muffled queen '' ?
my lord , i will use them according to their desert .
my lord , i will give them all they deserve .
come , sirs .
come , everyone .
ay , my lord .
yes , my lord .
ay , my lord .
yes , my lord .
good my lord .
yes , my lord .
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
and you ca n't put your heads together and figure out why he 's acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
did he receive you well ?
did he treat you well when you saw him ?
most like a gentleman .
yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
but with much forcing of his disposition .
but it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us .
niggard of question , but of our demands most free in his reply .
he did n't ask questions , but answered ours at length .
't is most true , and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .
it 's true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
we shall , my lord .
we will , my lord .
madam , i wish it may .
i hope so too , madam .
good my lord , how does your honor for this many a day ?
hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
ha , ha , are you honest ?
ha ha , are you good ?
my lord ?
excuse me ?
are you fair ?
are you beautiful ?
what means your lordship ?
my lord , what are you talking about ?
that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
i 'm just saying that if you 're good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
but could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
you certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
i was the more deceived .
then i guess i was misled .
at home , my lord .
he 's at home , my lord .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
oh , dear god , please help him !
heavenly powers , restore him !
dear god , please make him normal again !
i warrant your honor .
i will , sir .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
i hope we 've corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
and the queen too , and that presently .
yes , he will , and the queen as well .
bid the players make haste .
tell the actors to hurry .
will you two help to hasten them ?
will you two help them get ready ?
ay , my lord .
yes , my lord .
what ho , horatio !
well , hello there , horatio !
here , sweet lord , at your service .
here i am at your service , my dear lord .
horatio , thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal .
horatio , you 're the best man i 've ever known .
o my dear lord
oh , sir
how fares our cousin hamlet ?
so how 's my nephew hamlet doing ?
what did you enact ?
what role did you play ?
claudius oh , ho , do you mark that ?
claudius hey , did you notice that ?
lady , shall i lie in your lap ?
my lady , should i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
no , my lord .
i mean , my head upon your lap ?
i mean , with my head in your lap ?
ay , my lord .
yes , my lord .
do you think i meant country matters ?
did you think i was talking about sex ?
i think nothing , my lord .
i think , my lord .
that 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
that 's a nice thought to lie between a girl 's legs .
what is , my lord ?
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
you 're in a good mood tonight , my lord .
who , i ?
who , me ?
ay , my lord .
yes , my lord .
nay , 't is twice two months , my lord .
no , my lord , it 's been four months .
what means this , my lord ?
what does this mean , my lord ?
belike this show imports the argument of the play .
this pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
, , .
.
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring ?
was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
't is brief , my lord .
it was a bit short , my lord .
as woman 's love .
yes , as short as a woman 's love .
, , .
.
wormwood , wormwood .
harsh !
if she should break it now !
nice vow , but what if she breaks it ?
, .
.
madam , how like you this play ?
madam , how are you liking this play ?
the lady protests too much , methinks .
the lady 's overdoing it , i think .
oh , but she 'll keep her word .
oh , but she 'll keep her word .
what do you call the play ?
what 's the play called ?
this is one lucianus , nephew to the king .
this is lucianus , the king 's nephew in the play .
you are as good as a chorus , my lord .
you 're an expert commentator , are n't you ?
you are keen , my lord , you are keen .
ooh , you 're sharp .
it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge .
yes , pointy , but you could take the edge off me though it might make you moan a little .
still better and worse .
you get better in your jokes and worse in your manners .
the king rises .
the king is getting up .
what , frighted with false fire ?
what is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
how fares my lord ?
my lord , how are you feeling ?
give o'er the play .
stop the play .
lights , lights , lights !
lights , lights , get us some lights !
half a share .
they might even give you half a share of the company .
you might have rhymed .
you could have at least .
very well , my lord .
yes , i did , my lord .
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
when the actors were talking about poison ?
i did very well note him .
i watched him very closely .
good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
my lord , could i have a word with you ?
sir , a whole history .
you can have a whole story , not just a word .
the king , sir
sir , the king
ay , sir , what of him ?
yes , what about him ?
is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
he 's in his chambers now , and he 's extremely upset .
with drink , sir ?
what , an upset stomach from too much booze ?
no , my lord , with choler .
no , sir , he 's angry .
good my lord , put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair .
my lord , please try to stick to the subject at hand .
the queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
the queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
you are welcome .
it 's lovely to see you .
sir , i can not .
sir , i ca n't .
what , my lord ?
ca n't what , my lord ?
then thus she says : your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration .
she says that your behavior has astonished her .
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
she wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
my lord , you once did love me .
my lord , you used to like me .
and do still , by these pickers and stealers .
and still do , i swear by my hands .
sir , i lack advancement .
sir , i have no future ahead of me .
how can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ?
but how can you say that , when the king himself says you 're the heir to the danish throne ?
my lord , i can not .
i ca n't , my lord .
i pray you .
please .
believe me , i can not .
i 'm serious , i ca n't .
i do beseech you .
i 'm begging you .
i know no touch of it , my lord .
i have no idea how .
god bless you , sir .
hello and god bless you , sir .
my lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
my lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
by th ' mass , and 't is like a camel indeed .
by god , it does look like a camel .
methinks it is like a weasel .
to me it looks like a weasel .
it is backed like a weasel .
it does have a back like a weasel 's .
or like a whale .
or like a whale .
very like a whale .
yes , very much like a whale .
i will say so .
i 'll tell her .
`` by and by '' is easily said .
it 's easy enough to say `` soon . ''
leave me , friends .
now please leave me alone , my friends .
we will haste us .
we 'll hurry .
thanks , dear my lord .
thanks , my dear lord .
mother , mother , mother !
mother , mother , mother !

now mother , what 's this all about ?
hamlet , thou hast thy father much offended .
hamlet , you 've insulted your father .
mother , you have my father much offended .
mother , you 've insulted my father .
come , come , you answer with an idle tongue .
come on , you 're answering me foolishly .
go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
go on , you 're questioning me evilly .
why , how now , hamlet ?
hamlet , what , why ?
what 's the matter now ?
what 's the problem now ?
have you forgot me ?
have you forgotten who i am ?
nay , then i 'll set those to you that can speak .
in that case i 'll call in others who can still speak .
oh , i am slain .
oh , i 've been killed !
o me , what hast thou done ?
oh my god , what have you done ?
oh , what a rash and bloody deed is this !
oh , what a senseless , horrible act !

an earnest conjuration from the king , as england was his faithful tributary , as love between them like the palm might flourish , as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities , and many suchlike `` as 's '' of great charge , that , on the view and knowing of these contents , without debatement further , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not shriving time allowed .
a sincere plea from the king , who commands the respect of england , and who hopes that the love between the two countries can flourish , and that peace can join them in friendship and other fancy mumbo jumbo like that saying that , once they read this document , without any debate , the ones delivering the letter should be put to death immediately , without giving them time to confess to a priest .

we are fortunate in the change .
it must be so , for miracles are ceased , and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected .
that must be it , because the age of miracles is passed , and we have to find reasonable explanations for why these things happen .
how did this offer seem received , my lord ?
how did he take the offer , my lord ?
with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear , as i perceived his grace would fain have done , the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , and generally to the crown and seat of france , derived from edward , his great-grandfather .
favorably , except that there was n't enough time for his grace to hear , as i sensed he would have liked to , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in france , and to the throne of france in general , through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather , edward iii .
what was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
what kept you from telling him this ?
it is .

god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it .
may god and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
may i with right and conscience make this claim ?
can i justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood .
the other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive , just like your lion-hearted forebears .
we must not only arm t ' invade the french , but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot , who will make road upon us with all advantages .
we must not only arm ourselves to invade france , but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the scots , who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack .
they of those marches , gracious sovereign , shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers .
your subjects in the north , gracious sovereign , will provide a wall of defense against scottish thieves across the border .
if we , with thrice such powers left at home , can not defend our own doors from the dog , let us be worried , and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy .
if we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .

let us condole the knight , for , lambkins , we will live .
let us go sit with the knight ; for , my little lambs , we will survive him .
'fore god , his grace is bold to trust these traitors .
i must say , the king is taking a bold risk letting these traitors go free .
they shall be apprehended by and by .
they 'll be arrested in a little while .
the king hath note of all that they intend , by interception which they dream not of .
the king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
nay , but the man that was his bedfellow , whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors that he should , for a foreign purse , so sell his sovereign 's life to death and treachery !
no , but it 's unbelievable that the man who was his dearest friend , a man he has showered with love and favor , would repay the king with treachery , selling his own sovereign 's life to a foreign power !
no doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
no doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
i doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours , nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us .
i have no doubt about that , since i know there is n't a man among us who is n't with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who does n't wish us success and conquest .
so service shall with steeld sinews toil , and labor shall refresh itself with hope to do your grace incessant services .
and so your subjects serve you all the more energetically , hopeful of success and reward .
oh , let us yet be merciful .

so did you me , my liege .
you told me to do the same , my liege .
and i , my royal sovereign .
and me , too , my royal sovereign .
i do confess my fault , and do submit me to your highness ' mercy .
i confess my crime and throw myself on your highness 's mercy .

he said once the devil would have him about women .
he once said the devil would get him because of women .
he did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the whore of babylon .

if signor leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina , as like him as she is .
well , even if he is her father , i 'm sure she would n't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
god keep your ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle- man or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face .

in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on .
i think she 's the most wonderful woman i 've ever laid eyes on .
i would scarce trust myself , though i had sworn the contrary , if hero would be my wife .
even if i had sworn never to marry , i would n't trust myself to keep that promise if hero would marry me .
what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato 's ?
what secrets between you have kept you from following us to leonato 's ?
i would your grace would constrain me to tell .
your highness will have to force me to tell .
i charge thee on thy allegiance .
your loyalty to me requires you to tell me what you 've been talking about .
if this were so , so were it uttered .
if you say so .
like the old tale , my lord : `` it is not so nor 't was not so but , indeed , god forbid it should be so . ''
listen to him deny it , like that man in the old tale `` mr. fox '' : `` it is n't true and was n't true and god forbid it should be so . ''
if my passion change not shortly , god forbid it should be otherwise .
unless my feelings change very soon , i have to admit it 's true .
amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
it 's good if you love hero , because she 's worthy of your love .
you speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
you 're trying to trick me , my lord .
by my troth , i speak my thought .
i swear , i 'm telling you what i honestly think .
and , in faith , my lord , i spoke mine .
and i swear i spoke honestly to benedick i am in love with hero .
and by my two faiths and troths , my lord , i spoke mine .
and swear all up and down i spoke honestly when i said that this was a horrible idea .
that i love her , i feel .
i feel that i love her .
that she is worthy , i know .
i know that she is worthy of that love .
thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty .
you never did believe in the power of beauty .
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
or in the power of reason .
i shall see thee , ere i die , look pale with love .
i swear , before i die i 'm going to see you sick with love .
if this should ever happen , thou wouldst be horn-mad .
if that ever happened , you 'd go absolutely mad .
i look for an earthquake too , then .
that 's about as likely as an earthquake .
my liege , your highness now may do me good .
my lord , you could really help me out now .
hath leonato any son , my lord ?
does leonato have a son , my lord ?
are they good ?
is it good news ?
hath the fellow any wit that told you this ?
is this servant of yours a smart man ?
what the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?
really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
and when i have heard it , what blessing brings it ?
and after i have sat and listened to reason , what 's my prize ?
if not a present remedy , at least a patient sufferance .
if not an end to your suffering , then at least you 'll have the means to endure it patiently .
can you make no use of your discontent ?
ca n't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
what news , borachio ?
what 's going on , borachio ?
marry , it is your brother 's right hand .
your brother 's right-hand man .
even he .
that 's the one .
marry , on hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
to the death , my lord .
until the day we die , my lord .
we 'll wait upon your lordship .
lead the way , sir .
was not count john here at supper ?
was n't don john at dinner tonight ?
i saw him not .
i did n't see him .
he is of a very melancholy disposition .
he has a very gloomy attitude .
then half signor benedick 's tongue in count john 's mouth , and half count john 's melancholy in signor benedick 's face
so , the man would talk half as much as benedick and be half as serious as don john
with a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
and if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world all he 'd need was her good will .
by my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
really , niece , you 'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
in faith , she 's too curst .
honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
so , by being too curst , god will send you no horns .
so then , for being too argumentative , god wo n't send you any horns ?
you may light on a husband that hath no beard .
maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
well then , go you into hell ?
so you 'll go to hell ?
hero well , niece , i trust you will be ruled by your father .
hero well , niece , i trust that you will defer to your father on these important decisions .
well , niece , i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband .
well , niece , i hope that i will see you married one day .
cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
lady , will you walk a bout with your friend ?
my lady , will you have a dance with me ?
with me in your company ?
will i be with you then ?
i may say so when i please .
perhaps , if i decide to let you .
and when please you to say so ?
and when will that be ?
when i like your favor , for god defend the lute should be like the case !
when i like the way you look , for god forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
my visor is philemon 's roof ; within the house is jove .
my mask is like the roof of the poor humble cottage ; underneath the mask , i am as magnificent as the glorious god jove .
why , then , your visor should be thatched .
well , then , since philemon 's roof was thatched with straw , your mask should have a beard .
speak low if you speak love .
if you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
well , i would you did like me .
well , i wish you liked me .
which is one ?
tell me one .
i say my prayers aloud .
i say my prayers out loud .
god match me with a good dancer !
god give me a good dance partner !
at a word , i am not .
no , really , i 'm not .
i know you by the waggling of your head .
i can tell by the way you waggle your head .
to tell you true , i counterfeit him .
really , i 'm only pretending to be him .
at a word , i am not .
in short , i 'm not .
will you not tell me who told you so ?
wo n't you tell me who told you that ?
no , you shall pardon me .
no , you 'll have to excuse me .
nor will you not tell me who you are ?
and you wo n't tell me who you are ?
not now .
not now .
what 's he ?
who 's that ?
i am sure you know him well enough .
i 'm sure you know him .
not i , believe me .
no i do n't , believe me .
did he never make you laugh ?
what , he never made you laugh ?
i pray you , what is he ?
please tell me , who is this man ?
when i know the gentleman , i 'll tell him what you say .
when i meet this gentleman , i 'll tell him what you 've said .
we must follow the leaders .
come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
in every good thing .
in every good thing they do .
nay , if they lead to any ill , i will leave them at the next turning .
no , if they try to lead us to harm , i will leave the dance floor at the next song .
claudio are not you signor benedick ?
claudio are n't you signior benedick ?
how know you he loves her ?
how do you know he loves her ?
i heard him swear his affection .
i heard him swear he did .
so did i too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
i did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
come , let us to the banquet .
come on , let 's get to the banquet .
count claudio ?
claudio ?
yea , the same .
yes , that 's me .
come , will you go with me ?
will you come with me ?
whither ?
where ?
i wish him joy of her .
i hope he enjoys her .
i pray you , leave me .
please , leave me alone .
if it will not be , i 'll leave you .
if you wo n't leave , then leave .
the flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
he was like a schoolboy who finds a bird 's nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner .
i only want to teach the baby birds to sing ; then i will return the nest to its rightful owner .
if their singing answer your saying , by my faith , you say honestly .
we 'll wait and see ; if the chicks follow your lead if hero is ready to love claudio then we 'll know you 're telling the truth .
look , here she comes .
look , here she comes .
none but to desire your good company .
nothing but your good company .
beatrice come , lady , come , you have lost the heart of signior benedick .
beatrice lady , you have lost signior benedick 's heart .
you have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
you 've humiliated him , lady : you 've put him down .
not sad , my lord .
i 'm not sad , my lord .
how then , sick ?
what then , sick ?
neither , my lord .
i 'm neither , my lord .
the count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
the count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well he 's just civil , as seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
speak , count , 't is your cue .
speak , claudio , that 's your cue .
in faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
and so she doth , cousin .
why , you 're absolutely right , cousin .
lady beatrice , i will get you one .
lady beatrice , i 'll get you a husband .
will you have me , lady ?
will you take me , my lady ?
niece , will you look to those things i told you of ?
niece , will you take care of those things i mentioned ?
by my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady .
i swear , she 's a very good-natured lady .
she can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
she ca n't stand to hear about getting a husband .
she were an excellent wife for benedict .
she would make a good wife for benedick .
o lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
oh , lord , if they were married , they 'd drive themselves crazy within a week .
county claudio , when mean you to go to church ?
count claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
my lord , i am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
my lord , i will help you , even if it means i have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
and i , my lord .
me too , my lord .
and you too , gentle hero ?
and you , sweet hero ?
i will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
i 'll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
yea , my lord , but i can cross it .
yes , my lord , but i can spoil it .
not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
i can only do it by lying , my lord , but i can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
show me briefly how .
quickly , tell me how .
i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favor of margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to hero .
i think it was a year ago that i told you how much margaret , hero 's servant woman , likes me .
i remember .
i remember .
i can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady 's chamber window .
i can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out hero 's bedroom window .
what life is in that to be the death of this marriage ?
how will that kill this marriage ?
what proof shall i make of that ?
what will be my evidence ?
only to despite them , i will endeavor anything .
that 's all i want , and i 'll do anything to accomplish it .
be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
if you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning wo n't fail me .
i will presently go learn their day of marriage .
i 'll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
boy !
boy !
signior ?
yes signior ?
i am here already , sir .
i 'm already here , sir .
i know that , but i would have thee hence and here again .
i see that you are here , but i 'd like you to go there and then come back again .
come , shall we hear this music ?
well , should we hear some music ?
claudio see you where benedick hath hid himself ?
claudio do you see where benedick is hiding ?
come , balthasar , we 'll hear that song again .
come on , balthasar , let 's hear that song again .
o , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music anymore than once .
oh , my good lord , do n't make me insult music again with my awful singing .
note this before my notes : there 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting .
just know this before i begin : i ca n't play a single note that 's worthy of note .
by my troth , a good song .
that 's a good song .
and an ill singer , my lord .
and a bad singer , my lord .
the best i can , my lord .
i 'll do the best i can , my lord .
by my troth , my lord , i can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
really , my lord , i do n't know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it 's past all understanding .
may be she doth but counterfeit .
maybe she 's just pretending .
faith , like enough .
yes , that 's quite likely .
why , what effects of passion shows she ?
why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
leonato bait the hook well ; this fish will bite .
leonato bait the hook well ; this fish is going to bite .
she did indeed .
yes , she did tell us .
i would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against benedick .
i would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against benedick .
hath she made her affection known to benedick ?
has she told benedick how she feels ?
now you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
now that you speak of paper , i remember a funny story of hero 's .
oh , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found `` benedick '' and `` beatrice '' between the sheet ?
oh , you mean when beatrice writes a letter and hero sees that it has `` benedick '' and `` beatrice '' written all over it ?
that .
yes , that 's the one .
it were good that benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
if she wo n't tell benedick , someone else should .
and she is exceeding wise .
and she is very smart .
in every thing but in loving benedick .
except for the fact that she loves benedick .
were it good , think you ?
is that a good idea , do you think ?
hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
hero thinks beatrice will surely die , for she says she 'll die if he does n't love her , and that she 'll die before she tells him , and she 'll die if he woos her and she 's made to hold back even one of her usual insults .
he is a very proper man .
he 's a very proper man .
he hath indeed a good outward happiness .
indeed , he is good-looking and carries himself well .
before god , and in my mind , very wise .
and i swear to god he 's very smart .
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
he does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
and i take him to be valiant .
and i believe him to be brave .
don pedro leonato if he do not dote on her upon this , i will never trust my expectation .
don pedro leonato if he does n't fall in love with her now , i 'll never trust my intuition again .
against my will , i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
against my will , i 've been told to bring you in to dinner .
fair beatrice , i thank you for your pains .
lovely beatrice , i thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
you take pleasure then in the message ?
so you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
i 'll make her come , i warrant you , presently .
i 'll make her come right away , i promise you .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely ?
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice that much ?
so says the prince and my new-trothd lord .
that 's what the prince and my fianc say .
and did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
and did they ask you to tell beatrice about this , madam ?
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it , but i persuaded them , if they loved benedick , to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it .
they did want me to tell her , but i persuaded them that , if they truly loved benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep beatrice in the dark .
sure , sure , such carping is not commendable .
it 's true , her nitpicking is hardly admirable .
he is the only man of italy , always excepted my dear claudio .
he 's the only worthy man in italy , aside from my dear claudio .
indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
true , he has an excellent reputation .
i do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go i toward aragon .
i 'll stay in messina until you 're married , and then i 'll go to aragon .
i 'll bring you thither , my lord , if you 'll vouchsafe me .
i 'll go with you , my lord , if you 'll allow me .
gallants , i am not as i have been .
gentleman , i am not the same man i was before .
i hope he be in love .
i hope he 's in love .
i have the toothache .
i have a .
what , sigh for the toothache ?
what , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
where is but a humor or a worm .
it could only have been caused by some humor or .
well , everyone can master a grief but he that has it .
well , everyone knows how to overcome an injury except the one who actually has one .
yet say i , he is in love .
i repeat , he 's in love .
hath any man seen him at the barber 's ?
has any man seen him at the barber 's ?
indeed , he looks younger than he did , by the loss of a beard .
getting rid of the beard definitely makes him look younger .
that 's as much as to say , the sweet youth 's in love .
that 's as good as proof that the sweet young man 's in love .
the greatest note of it is his melancholy .
the biggest clue is his seriousness .
and when was he wont to wash his face ?
and when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops
indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a , and he can be played like an instrument
nay , but i know who loves him .
oh , and i know who loves him .
yes , and his ill conditions , and , in despite of all , dies for him .
no , she does know him , and she also knows all his bad qualities and in spite of all this , she still dies for him .
she shall be buried with her face upwards .
she 'll be buried with her face upwards , then .
for my life , to break with him about beatrice !
i bet my life he 's gone to speak with leonato about beatrice !
my lord and brother , god save you .
my lord and brother , god save you .
good e'en , brother .
good evening , brother .
if your leisure served , i would speak with you .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like to speak with you .
in private ?
in private ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
claudio means your lordship to be married tomorrow ?
claudio do you plan on getting married tomorrow ?
you know he does .
you know that he does .
i know not that , when he knows what i know .
i do n't know that , once he knows what i know .
if there be any impediment , i pray you discover it .
if there 's any reason we should n't get married , i urge you to tell me .
why , what 's the matter ?
why , what 's the matter ?
i came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .
i came here to tell you i 'll make this short , since she 's already been talked about for too long the lady is unfaithful .
who , hero ?
who , hero ?
even she : leonato 's hero , your hero , every man 's hero .
that 's the one : leonato 's hero , your hero , every man 's hero .
disloyal ?
unfaithful ?
don pedro may this be so ?
don pedro is this possible ?
i will not think it .
i wo n't consider it .
if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where i should wed , there will i shame her .
if i see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , i 'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where i would have married her .
and as i wooed for thee to obtain her , i will join with thee to disgrace her .
and since i wooed her in your name , i 'll join you in disgracing her .
o day untowardly turned !
oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
o mischief strangely thwarting !

are you good men and true ?
are you all good and honest men ?
yea , or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation , body and soul .
yes they are , otherwise it would be proper for them to suffer , body and soul .
nay , that were a punishment too good for them , if they should have any allegiance in them , being chosen for the prince 's watch .
if they had any when they were chosen for the prince 's watch , a punishment like that would be too good for them .
well , give them their charge , neighbor dogberry .
well , give them their assignment , sir dogberry .
first , who think you the most desartless man to be constable ?
first , which man do you think is most to be leader of the watch ?
hugh otecake , sir , or george seacole , for they can write and read .
either hugh otecake , sir , or else george seacole , because both of them can read and write .
both which , master constable
both of which , master constable
how if he will not stand ?
and what if he wo n't stop ?
if he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the prince 's subjects .
if he wo n't stop when he 's told to , then he is n't one of the prince 's subjects .
how if they will not ?
and what if they wo n't go ?
well , sir .
very good , sir .
if we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?

if you hear a child cry in the night , you must call to the nurse and bid her still it .
if you hear a child crying in the night , you should call the nurse and tell her to quiet the child .
how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us ?
what if the nurse is asleep and does n't hear us ?
't is very true .
that 's very true .
nay , by 'r lady , that i think he can not .
no , by our lady , i do n't think he can .
by 'r lady , i think it be so .
by our lady , i think that 's true .

since it 's drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , i 'll tell you everything .
therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats .
you should know i 've earned a thousand gold pieces from don john .
is it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?
is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
i wonder at it .
i ca n't believe it .
yes , it is apparel .
yes , it 's just clothing .
i mean the fashion .
no , i mean , the fashion of a man 's clothing tells us nothing about the man .
yes , the fashion is the fashion .
yes , fashion is fashion .

truly , my friend , he is n't nearly as impressive as you are .
gifts that god gives .
god gives those gifts i had nothing to do with it .
i must leave you .
now i must return to the wedding .
it shall be suffigance .
that will be .
my lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
my lord , they 're waiting for you to give your daughter away to claudio .
and we must do it wisely .
we must do this wisely .
claudio you come hither , my lord , to marry this lady ?
claudio have you come here , my lord , to marry this lady ?
no .
no .
lady , you come hither to be married to this count ?
lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
i do .
i do .
if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .
if either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , i order you on your souls to say so .
know you any , hero ?
do you know any , hero ?
none , my lord .
none , my lord .
know you any , count ?
do you know any , count ?
i dare make his answer , none .
i 'm sure i can answer for him he does n't know any , either .
as freely , son , as god did give her me .
as freely , son , as god gave her to me .
and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
and what should i give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
nothing , unless you render her again .
nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
what do you mean , my lord ?
what do you mean , my lord ?
dear my lord , if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity
my dear lord , if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity
and seemed i ever otherwise to you ?
and have i ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
sweet prince , why speak not you ?
good prince , say something !
are these things spoken , or do i but dream ?
are you really saying these things , or am i dreaming ?
sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
they 're really being spoken , sir , and they 're true .
this looks not like a nuptial .
this does n't look like a wedding .
all this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
yes , that 's all true but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
let me but move one question to your daughter , and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her , bid her answer truly .
let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
i charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
as my child , i order you to do so .
to make you answer truly to your name .
we just want you to answer to your real name .
i talked with no man at that hour , my lord .
i was n't talking to any man at that time , my lord .
hath no man 's dagger here a point for me ?
does anyone have a dagger for me ?
how doth the lady ?
how is she ?
how now , cousin hero !
how are you , hero ?
hero have comfort , lady .
hero take comfort , lady .
hero dost thou look up ?
hero are you looking up ?
yea , wherefore should she not ?
yes , why should n't she ?
but mine , and mine i loved , and mine i praised , and mine that i was proud on , mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine , valuing of her why , she , o she is fall'n into a pit of ink , that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh !
oh , but now you have fallen into a pit of ink , and there 's not enough water in the whole wide sea to wash you clean again , and not enough salt to cover your stink .
oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
no , truly not , although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
no , i did n't , but i did every night for the past year .
trust not my reading nor my observations , which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book ; trust not my age , my reverence , calling , nor divinity , if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error .
you can doubt all these things if this sweet lady turns out to be guilty .
lady , what man is he you are accused of ?
lady , who do they accuse you of having taken as your lover ?
there is some strange misprision in the princes .
the princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
two of them have the very bent of honor , and if their wisdoms be misled in this , the practice of it lives in john the bastard , whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .
two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame john the bastard , who lives to create conflict .
being that i flow in grief , the smallest twine may lead me .
because i 'm drowning in my grief , i 'll grab onto the smallest piece of string dangled in front of me .
lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
lady beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
yea , and i will weep a while longer .
yes , and i 'll keep crying a while longer .
i will not desire that .
i do n't wish that on you .
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
i really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
is there any way to show such friendship ?
is there any way i could show such friendship to you ?
a very even way , but no such friend .
a very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
may a man do it ?
can a man do it ?
it is a man 's office , but not yours .
it 's a job meant for a man , but not you .
by my sword , beatrice , thou lovest me .
by my sword , beatrice , you love me .
do not swear , and eat it .
do n't swear like that and then go back and later .
i will swear by it that you love me , and i will make him eat it that says i love not you .
i 'll swear by my that you love me , too , and i 'll make any man who says that i do n't love you eat it .
will you not eat your word ?
but you wo n't eat your words ?
why then , god forgive me .
well then , god forgive me !

why , what have you done , sweet beatrice ?
and do it with all thy heart .
then do so , with all your heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .

give us the swords ; we have bucklers of our own .
no , you should give a woman your sword we have our own !
if you use them , margaret , you must put in the pikes with a vice , and they are dangerous weapons for maids .

well , i am glad that all things sort so well .
well , i 'm glad that everything has been sorted out .

there 's none so foul and foolish thereunto , but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do .
no matter how ugly or stupid the woman is , she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do .
she that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lacked gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish and yet said `` now i may , '' she that being angered , her revenge being nigh , bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod 's head for the salmon 's tail , she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind , she was a wight , if ever such wights were
a woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would
to do what ?
would do what ?
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
would raise babies and clip coupons .
't is truly so .
yes , it is .
let 's meet him and receive him .
let 's go greet him when he lands .
lo , where he comes !
look , here he comes .
oh my fair warrior !
my beautiful warrior !
my dear othello !
my darling othello !
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow .
god willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
oh , you are well tuned now , but i 'll set down the pegs that make this music , as honest as i am .
oh , you 're happy now , but i 'll ruin your happiness , for all my supposed honesty .
well .
all right .
i will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .
i 'll do it , if you help me out .
adieu .
goodbye .
she 's a most exquisite lady .
she 's an exquisitely beautiful lady .
and , i 'll warrant her , full of game .
and i bet she 's good in bed too .
indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature .
yes , she 's young and tender .
and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
and when she speaks , does n't her voice stir up passion ?
she is indeed perfection .
she 's a perfect woman , it 's true .
where are they ?
where are they ?
i 'll do 't , but it dislikes me .
i 'll do it , but i do n't like it .
'fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
my god , they 've given me a lot to drink .
good faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier .
no , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
fore heaven , an excellent song .
my god , what a great song !
is your englishman so expert in his drinking ?
are englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
to the health of our general !

god , that song 's even better than the other one .
will you hear 't again ?
do you want to hear it again ?
it 's true , good lieutenant .
that 's true , lieutenant .
for mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved .

how comes it , michael , you are thus forgot ?
how did you manage to lose your self-control like this , michael ?
if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier .
i know you 're close to cassio , but if you diverge from the truth in any way , you 're not a true soldier .
what 's the matter , dear ?
what 's the matter , dear ?
what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
are you hurt , lieutenant ?
ay , past all surgery .
yes , but no doctor can help me .
marry , heaven forbid !
oh i hope that 's not true !
i know not .
i do n't know .
is 't possible ?
is that possible ?
you advise me well .
that 's good advice .
i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
i 'm helping you because i like and respect you .
good night , honest iago .
good night , honest iago .
how now , roderigo !
hello , roderigo !
are these , i pray you , wind instruments ?
are these wind instruments ?
ay , marry , are they , sir .
yes , they are .
oh , thereby hangs a tail .
oh , there 's the problem .
whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
what 's the problem ?
well , sir , we will not .
well , we 'll stop , then .
we have none such , sir .
we do n't have any music that ca n't be heard .
dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
do you hear , my friend ?
in happy time , iago .
good to see you , iago .
you have not been abed , then ?
you did n't go to sleep , then ?
i humbly thank you for't .
i humbly thank you .
i never knew a florentine more kind and honest .
even for a , i never knew someone so kind and honest .
yet i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone .
please find a way to give me some time alone with desdemona , if you think that 's all right .
i am much bound to you .
thank you very much .
well , my good lord , i 'll do 't .
i will , my lord .
this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?
shall we go see this fortification , men ?
we 'll wait upon your lordship .
we 're at your service , my lord .
be thou assured , good cassio , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .
i 'll do everything i can for you , cassio .
bounteous madam , whatever shall become of michael cassio , he 's never anything but your true servant .
my dear beautiful lady , whatever happens to michael cassio , he 'll always be your humble servant .
madam , here comes my lord .
madam , here comes your husband .
madam , i 'll take my leave .
madam , i 'd better leave now .
why , stay and hear me speak .
why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
well , do your discretion .
well , do whatever you think best .
what dost thou say ?
what did you say ?
nothing , my lord , or if i know not what .
nothing , my lord , or if i did i do n't know what .
was not that cassio parted from my wife ?
was n't that cassio leaving my wife ?
i do believe 't was he .
i really think it was him .
who is 't you mean ?
who do you mean ?
went he hence now ?
was that him just now ?
but shall 't be shortly ?
but will it be soon ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
very soon , because you want it .
shall 't be tonight at supper ?
will it be tonight at supper ?
no , not tonight .
no , not tonight .
tomorrow dinner , then ?
then tomorrow at dinner ?
my noble lord
my noble lord
what dost thou say , iago ?
what is it , iago ?
did michael cassio , when you wooed my lady , know of your love ?
when you were wooing desdemona , did michael cassio know about it ?
why of thy thought , iago ?
why are you curious , iago ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .
i did n't realize he knew her .
indeed ?
oh , really ?
honest , my lord ?
honest , my lord ?
honest , ay , honest .
honest , yes , honest .
my lord , for aught i know .
as far as i know , sir .
what dost thou think ?
what are you thinking ?
think , my lord ?
thinking , my lord ?
my lord , you know i love you .
my lord , you know i 'm your friend .
for michael cassio , i dare be sworn , i think , that he is honest .
as for michael cassio , i think it would be safe for me to swear that he 's honest .
i think so too .
i think so too .
certain , men should be what they seem .
absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
why then i think cassio 's an honest man .
in that case , i think cassio 's an honest man .
thou dost conspire against thy friend , iago , if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .
you 're not being a good friend , iago , if you even your friend has been wronged and you do n't tell him about it .
nor for my manhood , honesty , and wisdom to let you know my thoughts .
it would n't be wise , honest , or responsible for me to tell them .
what dost thou mean ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'll know thy thoughts .
i 'm going to find out what you 're thinking .
ha !
what ?
oh , misery !
oh , what misery !
dost thou say so ?
do you really think so ?
and so she did .
that 's right , she did .
i am bound to thee forever .
i 'm indebted to you forever .
i see this hath a little dashed your spirits .
you seem a little depressed about this .
not a jot , not a jot .
not at all , not at all .
i will not .
i wo n't .
and yet how nature , erring from itself
but still , it 's true that good things can go bad , away from their true natures
my lord , i take my leave .
my lord , i 'll say goodbye now .
fear not my government .
do n't worry about how i handle it .
i once more take my leave .
i 'll say goodbye once more .
i am to blame .
i 'm sorry .
i have a pain upon my forehead , here .
i have a , right here in my forehead .
come , i 'll go in with you .
come on , i 'll escort you to dinner .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
i 'm very sorry you 're not feeling well .
ha ?
what ?
to have a foolish wife .
to have a stupid wife .
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
hast stolen it from her ?
you stole it from her ?
a good wench , give it me .
good girl , give it to me .
why , what is that to you ?
what 's it to you ?
how now , my lord !
what 's with you , my lord ?
i am sorry to hear this .
i 'm sorry to hear this .
is 't possible , my lord ?
is this possible , my lord ?
is 't come to this ?
has it come to this ?
my noble lord
my noble lord
give me a living reason she 's disloyal .
give me one good reason to think she 's cheating on me .
nay , this was but his dream .
no , it was just a dream .
but this denoted a foregone conclusion .
but it shows that something has already happened .
i 'll tear her all to pieces !
i 'll tear her to pieces !
if it be that
if it 's the same one
if it be that , or any that was hers , it speaks against her with the other proofs .
if it 's the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it 's pretty strong .
yet be content .
calm down
oh , blood , blood , blood !
i want blood !
i am your own for ever .
i 'm yours forever .
do you know , sirrah , where lieutenant cassio lies ?
excuse me , do you know which room lieutenant cassio ?
i dare not say he lies anywhere .
i would n't dare say he lies anywhere .
why , man ?
why do you say that ?
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie .
telling you where he 's sleeping is like telling you where i 'm lying .
can anything be made of this ?
what on earth does that mean ?
i know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
i do n't know where he 's staying , so if i told you he 's sleeping here or there , i 'd be lying .
can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
can you ask around and find out ?
i will catechize the world for him , that is , make questions , and by them answer .
i 'll go ask questions everywhere .
where should i lose that handkerchief , emilia ?
where could i have lost that handkerchief , emilia ?
i know not , madam .
i do n't know , madam .
is he not jealous ?
he 's not jealous ?
look where he comes .
look , here he comes .
well , my good lord .
i 'm fine , my lord .
it hath felt no age nor known no sorrow .
it 's moist because it 's still young and inexperienced .
what promise , chuck ?
what did i promise , my dear ?
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you .
i sent for cassio to come talk with you .
here , my lord .
here , my lord .
that which i gave you .
no , the one i gave you .
i have it not about me .
i do n't have it with me .
not ?
you do n't ?
no , indeed , my lord .
no , my lord .
is 't possible ?
is that possible ?
most veritable , therefore look to 't well .
it 's absolutely true , so take good care of it .
then would to heaven that i had never seen 't !
i wish i had never seen it !
why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
bless us !
god help me !
say you ?
what do you have to say for yourself ?
it is not lost , but what and if it were ?
it 's not lost , but what if it were ?
how !
what do you mean ?
i say , it is not lost .
i 'm telling you , it 's not lost .
fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives .
bring me the handkerchief my mind is full of doubt .
the handkerchief !
the handkerchief !
the handkerchief !
the handkerchief !
in sooth , you are to blame .
really , i do n't think you 're behaving very well .
away !
damn it !
is not this man jealous ?
and you say he 's not jealous ?
is my lord angry ?
is othello angry ?
he went hence but now , and certainly in strange unquietness .
he just left , clearly upset about something .
i prithee , do so .
please , do so .
pray heaven it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you .
i hope to god it 's something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
heaven keep the monster from othello 's mind !
i hope god keeps that monster from growing in othello 's mind !
lady , amen .
amen to that , lady .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
i thank you , lady .
save you , friend cassio !
hello , cassio !
why , whose is it ?
well , whose is it ?
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me womaned .
i 'm waiting here for the general , and i do n't want him to see me with a woman .
why , i pray you ?
and why 's that ?
not that i love you not .
it 's not because i do n't love you .
will you think so ?
do you really think so ?
think so , iago ?
what do you mean , do i think so ?
what , to kiss in private ?
what , just because they kissed in private ?
an unauthorized kiss !
an illicit kiss !
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they did n't do anything .
what then ?
then what ?
ay , what of that ?
yes , what about it ?
that 's not so good now .
that 's not good .
hath he said any thing ?
has he said anything ?
he hath , my lord , but be you well assured no more than he 'll unswear .
yes , but he 'd deny it all .
what hath he said ?
what did he say ?
why , that he did i know not what he did .
he said he did i do n't know .
lie
he was in bed with
with her ?
with her ?
with her , on her , what you will .
with her , on top of her however you want to say it .
how now , cassio !
hey , cassio !
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
rub him about the temples .
rub his temples .
dost thou mock me ?
are you making fun of me ?
there 's many a beast then in a populous city , and many a civil monster .
in that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city .
did he confess it ?
did he confess ?
alas , poor caitiff !
the poor thing !
look how he laughs already !
he 's laughing already !
i never knew woman love man so .
i never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
alas , poor rogue , i think indeed she loves me .
the poor thing , i really think she loves me .
now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .
now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
do you hear , cassio ?
have you heard this , cassio ?
ha , ha , ha !
ha , ha , ha !
why the cry goes that you shall marry her .
i swear , there 's a rumor going around that you 'll marry her .
prithee say true !
you 're kidding !
i am a very villain else .
if it 's not true , you can call me a villain .
well , i must leave her company .
i have to get rid of her .
by heaven , that should be my handkerchief !
my god , that 's my handkerchief !
after her , after her .
go after her , go .
will you sup there ?
will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
yes , i intend so .
yes , i will .
how shall i murder him , iago ?
how should i murder him , iago ?
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
o iago !
oh iago !
and did you see the handkerchief ?
and did you see the handkerchief ?
was that mine ?
was it mine ?
nay , you must forget that .
no , you have to forget all that now .
nay , that 's not your way .
but that 's not how you 're going to be .
she 's the worse for all this .
all the worse that she stooped this low , then .
oh , a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition !
oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times and what a sweet personality she has !
ay , too gentle .
yes , a little too sweet .
oh , 't is foul in her .
oh , it 's horrible of her .
with mine officer !
and with my own officer !
that 's fouler .
that 's worse .
excellent good .
excellent , good .
what trumpet is that same ?
what 's that trumpet for ?
save you , worthy general !
greetings , good general !
with all my heart , sir .
greetings , sir .
the duke and senators of venice greet you .
the duke and senators of venice greet you .
i kiss the instrument of their pleasures .
i 'll do whatever they order me to do in this letter .
and what 's the news , good cousin lodovico ?
what 's new , cousin lodovico ?
lives , sir .
well , he 's alive .
are you sure of that ?
are you sure of that ?
my lord ?
excuse me ?
`` this fail you not to do , as you will ``
`` do n't fail to do this , since you 'll ``
fire and brimstone !
damn it all !
my lord ?
excuse me , my lord ?
are you wise ?
are you in your right mind ?
what , is he angry ?
is he angry ?
trust me , i am glad on 't .
i 'm happy about that .
indeed !
oh , are you really !
my lord ?
my lord ?
i am glad to see you mad .
i 'm glad you 're insane enough to admit it in front of me .
why , sweet othello
why , sweet othello
devil !
you devil !
i have not deserved this .
i have n't done anything to deserve this !
i will not stay to offend you .
i would n't want to stay here and make you angry .
mistress !
madam !
my lord ?
my lord ?
what would you with her , sir ?
what do you want with her , sir ?
who , i , my lord ?
who , me ?
he is much changed .
he 's changed a great deal .
i am sorry that i am deceived in him .
i 'm sorry i was so wrong about him .
you have seen nothing then ?
you have n't seen anything , then ?
nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
no , and i did n't hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
yes , you have seen cassio and she together .
but you 've seen her and cassio together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them .
yes , but i did n't see anything wrong , and i heard every syllable they said .
what , did they never whisper ?
did n't they ever whisper ?
never , my lord .
never , my lord .
nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
or ask you to leave the room ?
never .
never .
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
never , my lord .
no , my lord .
that 's strange .
that 's strange .
my lord , what is your will ?
my lord , what do you want ?
pray , chuck , come hither .
please , dear , come here .
what is your pleasure ?
what can i do for you ?
what horrible fancy 's this ?
what horrible thing are you imagining ?
heaven doth truly know it .
heaven knows i am .
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
heaven knows you 're as unfaithful as hell .
ah , desdemona , away , away , away !
leave me alone , desdemona , go away !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
i hope you think i 'm faithful to you .
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
have i done something to offend you without knowing it ?
by heaven , you do me wrong !
i swear to god you 're accusing me wrongly !
are you not a strumpet ?
so you 're saying you 're not a whore ?
what , not a whore ?
what , you 're not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
no , i swear it .
is 't possible ?
is that possible ?
oh , heaven forgive us !
oh , heaven help us !
faith , half asleep .
i 'm stunned , to tell you the truth .
good madam , what 's the matter with my lord ?
my lady , what 's wrong with your husband ?
with who ?
with who ?
who is thy lord ?
who 's your lord ?
he that is yours , sweet lady .
my lord is your lord .
here 's a change indeed !
things have certainly changed !
what is the matter , lady ?
what 's the matter , lady ?
alas , iago , my lord hath so bewhored her , thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her , that true hearts can not bear it .
he called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people ca n't stand to hear it .
am i that name , iago ?
am i that name , iago ?
what name , fair lady ?
what name , madam ?
such as she says my lord did say i was .
what my lord said i was .
why did he so ?
why did he do that ?
it is my wretched fortune .
it 's just my bad luck .
nay , heaven doth know .
heaven knows .
if any such there be , heaven pardon him !
if there is , then heaven help him !
speak within door .
keep your voice down .
if 'twere no other
if only that were all it is
't is but so , i warrant .
it is , i promise .
how now , roderigo !
how are you , roderigo ?
i do not find that thou deal'st justly with me .
i do n't think you 're treating me fairly .
what in the contrary ?
what makes you say that ?
will you hear me , roderigo ?
will you listen to me , roderigo ?
you charge me most unjustly .
that 's not fair .
very well .
okay .
you have said now .
you 've said what you have to say now .
ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .
yes , and i 'll do everything i just said .
it hath not appeared .
it does n't look that way to me .
sir , there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello 's place .
venice has made cassio governor here on cyprus .
how do you mean , removing of him ?
what do you mean , get rid of him ?
why , by making him uncapable of othello 's place : knocking out his brains .
i mean knock his brains out , so he ca n't take othello 's place .
and that you would have me to do !
and that 's what you want me to do !
i will hear further reason for this .
i want to hear more about this .
i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
please , sir , do n't trouble yourself .
oh , pardon me , 'twill do me good to walk .
i beg your pardon ; walking will make me feel better .
your honor is most welcome .
you 're most welcome .
my lord ?
yes , my lord ?
i will , my lord .
i will , my lord .
dismiss me ?
send me away ?
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
i put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
shall i go fetch your nightgown ?
should i get your nightgown ?
a very handsome man .
he 's very handsome .
he speaks well .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
i know a lady in venice who 'd walk all the way to palestine for a kiss from him .
it 's the wind .
it 's the wind .
't is neither here nor there .
no , it does n't mean anything .
there be some such , no question .
there are women like that out there , no question .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
why , would not you ?
why , would n't you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
by the light of heaven , no , i would not !
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
in troth , i think thou wouldst not .
i do n't think you would .
beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world .
i 'd never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world , and having the world for your labor , 't is a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you 've won the whole world , it 's a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
i do not think there is any such woman .
i do n't think any woman like that exists .
oh , i am slain !
oh , i 'm dead !
oh , villain that i am !
oh , what a villain i am !
it is even so .
that 's the truth .
't is some mischance , the cry is very direful .
something 's wrong , the man sounds panicked .
oh , help !
oh , help !
hark !
listen !
oh , wretched villain !
i 've acted like such a villain !
hark !
look !
here 's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
here 's someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
we do not know .
we do n't know .
do not you hear a cry ?
did n't you hear someone shouting ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
lodovico this is othello 's ancient , as i take it .
lodovico that 's othello 's ensign , i think .
cassio what are you here that cry so grievously ?
cassio who 's shouting so loudly ?
i think that one of them is hereabout , and can not make away .
i think one of them is nearby and ca n't get away .
oh , help me there !
somebody help me over here !
that 's one of them .
that 's one of them .
as you shall prove us , praise us .
judge for yourself .
signior lodovico ?
signor lodovico ?
he , sir .
that 's me .
cassio !
cassio !
how is 't , brother !
how are you doing , brother ?
my leg is cut in two .
my leg 's been cut in two .
who is 't that cried ?
who 's shouting ?
no .
no .
what , of venice ?

i am glad to see you .
i 'm glad to see you .

uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible , as it were

yet
but
he could not miss 't .
he had to say it , it was unavoidable .
it must needs be of subtle , tender , and delicate temperance .
the island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .

alonso sir , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter , who is now queen .
alonso sir , we were saying that our clothes seem just as fresh as they did when we attended the wedding of your daughter , who 's now queen of tunis .
and the rarest that e'er came there .
the most beautiful queen they ever had .

i mean when i wore it at your daughter 's wedding .
no , no , he 's gone .

or docks , or mallows .
or thorn-bushes .
and were the king on 't , what would i do ?
and if i were king of it , you know what i 'd do ?
'scape being drunk for want of wine .
he would n't get drunk much , since there 's no wine here .
yet he would be king on 't .
he wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning .
yes , he 's getting a bit confused .
no marrying 'mong his subjects ?
there 'd be no marriage ?
i would with such perfection govern , sir , t ' excel the golden age .
i would rule so perfectly that my country would outshine the golden age they had in ancient times .

't was you we laughed at .
it 's you we were laughing at .
what a blow was there given !

we would so , and then go a-batfowling .

gonzalo nay , good my lord , be not angry .
gonzalo do n't be angry with us , my lord .
go sleep , and hear us .
go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
we two , my lord , will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety .
the two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .

claribel .
claribel , his daughter .

and how does your content tender your own good fortune ?
and does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
i remember you did supplant your brother prospero .
i remember you took the throne from your brother prospero .
but , for your conscience ?
but what about your guilty conscience ?
then let us both be sudden .
let 's act quickly .

i warrant you , sir , the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardor of my liver .
